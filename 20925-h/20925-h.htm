TO MY WIFE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREFACE<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the number of United States histories already in<br>
existence, and the excellence of many of them, I venture to think that<br>
no apology is needed for bringing forward another.<br>
<br>
1. The work now presented to the public is believed to utilize, more<br>
than any of its predecessors, the many valuable researches of recent<br>
years into the rich archives of this and other nations.<br>
<br>
2. Most of the briefer treatments of the subject are manuals, intended<br>
for pupils in schools, the conspicuous articulation so necessary for<br>
this purpose greatly lessening their interest for the general reader.<br>
The following narrative will be found continuous as well as of moderate<br>
compass.<br>
<br>
3. I have sought to make more prominent than popular histories have<br>
usually done, at the same time the political evolution of our country on<br>
the one hand, and the social culture, habits, and life of the people on<br>
the other.<br>
<br>
4. The work strives to observe scrupulous proportion in treating the<br>
different parts and phases of our national career, neglecting none and<br>
over-emphasizing none. Also, while pronouncedly national and patriotic,<br>
it is careful to be perfectly fair and kind to the people of all<br>
sections.<br>
<br>
5. Effort has been made to present the matter in the most natural<br>
periods and divisions, and to give such a title to each of these as to<br>
render the table of contents a truthful and instructive epitome of our<br>
national past.<br>
<br>
6. With the same aim the Fore-history is exhibited in sharp separation<br>
from the United States history proper, calling due attention to what is<br>
too commonly missed, the truly epochal character of the adoption of our<br>
present Constitution, in 1789.<br>
<br>
7. Copious illustration has been employed, with diligent study to make<br>
it for every reader in the highest degree an instrument of instruction,<br>
delight, and cultivation in art.<br>
<br>
8. No pains has been spared to secure perfect accuracy in all references<br>
to dates, persons, and places, so that the volumes may be used with<br>
confidence as a work of reference. I am persuaded that much success in<br>
this has been attained, despite the uncertainty still attaching to many<br>
matters of this sort in United States history, especially to dates.<br>

PUBLISHERS' NOTE<br>
<br>
The last edition of President Andrews's History was issued in 1905, in<br>
five volumes, and brought the narrative down to the inauguration of<br>
President Roosevelt in March of that year. In preparing the extension of<br>
the work by the addition of a sixth volume, entrusted to the competent<br>
hands of Professor James Alton James of Northwestern University, it has<br>
been thought desirable to begin this final volume with the chapters<br>
entitled "The Rise of Roosevelt" and "Mr. Roosevelt's Presidency." This<br>
has involved some expansion and revision of these chapters as well as<br>
the continuance of the History from 1905 to the present time. The<br>
Appendices, which include public documents of fundamental importance and<br>
the significant results in various fields of the Census of 1910, are an<br>
additional feature of the new edition.<br>

INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>
<br>
AMERICA BEFORE COLUMBUS<br>
<br>
Man made his appearance on the western continent unnumbered ages ago,<br>
not unlikely before the close of the glacial period. It is possible that<br>
human life began in Asia and western North America sooner than on either<br>
shore of the Atlantic. Nothing wholly forbids the belief that America<br>
was even the cradle of the race, or one of several cradles, though most<br>
scientific writers prefer the view that our species came hither from<br>
Asia. De Nadaillac judges it probable that the ocean was thus crossed<br>
not at Behring Strait alone, but along a belt of equatorial islands as<br>
well. We may think of successive waves of such immigration--perhaps the<br>
easiest way to account for certain differences among American races.<br>
<br>
It is, at any rate, an error to speak of the primordial Americans as<br>
derived from any Asiatic stock at present existing or known to history.<br>
The old Americans had scarcely an Asiatic feature. Their habits and<br>
customs were emphatically peculiar to themselves. Those in which they<br>
agreed with the trans-Pacific populations, such as fashion of weapons<br>
and of fortifications, elements of folk-lore, religious ideas,<br>
traditions of a flood, belief in the destruction of the world by fire,<br>
and so on, are nearly all found the world over, the spontaneous<br>
creations of our common human intelligence.<br>
<br>
The original American peoples, various and unlike as they were, agreed<br>
in four traits, three of them physical, one mental, which mark them off<br>
as in all likelihood primarily of one stock after all, and as different<br>
from any Old World men: (1) They had low, retreating foreheads. (2)<br>
Their hair was black. (3) It was also of a peculiar texture, lank, and<br>
cylindrical in section, never wavy. And (4) their languages were<br>
polysynthetic, forming a class apart from all others in the world. The<br>
peoples of America, if from Asia, must date back to a time when speech<br>
itself was in its infancy.<br>

<br>
The numerous varieties of ancient Americans reduce to two distinct types<br>
--the Dolicocephalous or long-skulled, and the Brachycephalous or<br>
short-skulled. Morton names these types respectively the Toltecan and<br>
the American proper. The Toltecan type was represented by the primitive<br>
inhabitants of Mexico and by the Mound-builders of our Mississippi<br>
Valley; the American proper, by the Indians. The Toltecans made far the<br>
closer approach to civilization, though the others possessed a much<br>
greater susceptibility therefor than the modern Indians of our prairies<br>
would indicate.<br>
<br>
Of the Mound-builders painfully little is known. Many of their mounds<br>
still remain, not less mysterious or interesting than the pyramids of<br>
Egypt, perhaps almost equally ancient. The skeletons exhumed from them<br>
often fly into dust as soon as exposed to air, a rare occurrence with<br>
the oldest bones found in Europe. On the parapet-crest of the Old Fort<br>
at Newark, 0., trees certainly five hundred years old have been cut, and<br>
they could not have begun their growth till long after the earth-works<br>
had been deserted. In some mounds, equally aged trees root in the<br>
decayed trunks of a still anterior growth.<br>
<br>
Much uncertainty continues to shroud the design of these mounds. Some<br>
were for military defence, others for burial places, others for lookout<br>
stations, others apparently for religious uses. Still others, it is<br>
supposed, formed parts of human dwellings. That they proceeded from<br>
intelligence and reflection is clear. Usually, whether they are squares<br>
or circles, their construction betrays nice, mathematical exactness,<br>
unattainable save by the use of instruments. Many constitute<br>
effigies--of birds, fishes, quadrupeds, men. In Wisconsin is a mound 135<br>
feet long and well proportioned, much resembling an elephant; in Adams<br>
County, 0., a gracefully curved serpent, 1,000 feet long, with jaws<br>
agape as if to swallow an egg-shaped figure in front; in Granville, in<br>
the same State, one in the form of a huge crocodile; in Greenup County,<br>
Ky., an image of a bear, which seems leaning forward in an attitude of<br>
observation, measuring 53 feet from the top of the back to the end of<br>
the foreleg, and 105-1/2 feet from the tip of the nose to the rear of<br>
the hind foot.<br>
<br>
</big><img src="images/025Pic600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big>&nbsp; Big Elephant Mound, Wisconsin.<br>
<br>
The sites of towns and cities were artfully selected, near navigable<br>
rivers and their confluences, as at Marietta, Cincinnati, and in<br>
Kentucky opposite the old mouth of the Scioto. Points for defence were<br>
chosen and fortified with scientific precision. The labor expended upon<br>
these multitudinous structures must have been enormous, implying a vast<br>
population and extensive social, economic, and civil organization. The<br>
Cahokia mound, opposite St. Louis, is 90 feet high and 900 feet long.<br>
<br>
The Mound-builders made elegant pottery, of various design and accurate<br>
shapes, worked bone and all sorts of stones, and even forged copper.<br>
There are signs that they understood smelting this metal. They certainly<br>
mined it in large quantities, and carried it down the Mississippi<br>
hundreds of miles from its source on Lake Superior. They must have been<br>
masters of river navigation, but their mode of conveying vast burdens<br>
overland, destitute of efficient draft animals as they apparently were,<br>
we can hardly even conjecture.<br>
<br>
The Mound-builders, as we have said, were related to the antique<br>
populations of Mexico and Central America, and the most probable<br>
explanation of their departure from their Northern seats is that in face<br>
of pestilence, or of some overpowering human foe, they retreated to the<br>
Southwest, there to lay, under better auspices, the foundations of new<br>
states, and to develop that higher civilization whose relics, too little<br>
known, astound the student of the past, as greatly as do the stupendous<br>
pillars of Carnac or the grotesque animal figures of Khorsabad and<br>
Nimrud.<br>
<br>
So much has been written about the American Indians that we need not<br>
discuss them at length. They were misnamed Indians by Columbus, who<br>
supposed the land he had discovered to be India. At the time of his<br>
arrival not more than two hundred thousand of them lived east of the<br>
Mississippi, though they were doubtless far more numerous West and<br>
South. Whence they came, or whether, if this was a human deed at all,<br>
they or another race now extinct drove out the Mound-builders, none can<br>
tell.<br>
<br>
Of arts the red man had but the rudest. He made wigwams, canoes, bone<br>
fish-hooks with lines of hide or twisted bark, stone tomahawks,<br>
arrow-heads and spears, clothing of skins, wooden bows, arrows, and<br>
clubs. He loved fighting, finery, gambling, and the chase. He<br>
domesticated no animals but the dog and possibly the hog. Sometimes<br>
brave, he was oftener treacherous, cruel, revengeful. His power of<br>
endurance on the trail or the warpath was incredible, and if captured,<br>
he let himself be tortured to death without a quiver or a cry. Though<br>
superstitious, he believed in a Great Spirit to be worshipped without<br>
idols, and in a future life of happy hunting and feasting.<br>
<br>
Whether, at the time of which we now speak, the Indians were an old<br>
race, already beginning to decline, or a fresh race, which contact with<br>
the whites balked of its development, it is difficult to say. Their<br>
career since best accords with the former supposition. In either case we<br>
may assume that their national groupings and habitats were nearly the<br>
same in 1500 as later, when these became accurately known. In the<br>
eighteenth century the Algonquins occupied all the East from Nova Scotia<br>
to North Carolina, and stretched west to the Mississippi. At one time<br>
they numbered ninety thousand. The Iroquois or Five Nations had their<br>
seat in Central and Western New York. North and west of them lived the<br>
Hurons or Wyandots. The Appalachians, embracing Cherokees, Creeks,<br>
Choctaws, Chickasaws, Seminoles and a number of lesser tribes, occupied<br>
all the southeastern portion of what is now the United States. West of<br>
the Mississippi were the Dakotas or Sioux.<br>
<br>
Since the white man's arrival upon these shores, very few changes have<br>
occurred among the brute inhabitants of North America. A few species, as<br>
the Labrador duck and the great auk, have perished. America then<br>
possessed but four animals which had appreciable economic value; the<br>
dog, the reindeer at the north, which the Mound-builders used as a<br>
draft animal but the Indians did not, and the llama and the paco south<br>
of the equator. Every one of our present domestic animals originated<br>
beyond the Atlantic, being imported hither by our ancestors. The Indians<br>
of the lower Mississippi Valley, when De Soto came, had dogs, and also<br>
what the Spaniards called hogs, perhaps peccaries, but neither brute was<br>
of any breed now bred in the country. A certain kind of dogs were native<br>
also to the Juan Fernandez and the Falkland Islands.<br>
<br>
Mr. Edward John Payne is doubtless correct in maintaining, in his<br>
"History of the New World called America," that the backwardness of the<br>
American aborigines was largely due to their lack of animals suitable<br>
for draft or travel or producing milk or flesh good for food. From the<br>
remotest antiquity Asiatics had the horse, ass, ox and cow, camel and<br>
goat--netting ten times the outfit in useful animals which the<br>
Peruvians, Mexicans, or Indians enjoyed.<br>
<br>
The vegetable kingdom of Old America was equally restricted, which also<br>
helps explain its low civilization. At the advent of the Europeans the<br>
continent was covered with forests. Then, though a few varieties may<br>
have since given out and some imported ones run wild, the undomesticated<br>
plants and trees were much as now. Not so the cultivated kinds. The<br>
Indians were wretched husbandmen, nor had the Mound-builders at all the<br>
diversity of agricultural products so familiar to us. Tobacco, Indian<br>
corn, cocoa, sweet potatoes, potatoes, the custard apple, the Jerusalem<br>
artichoke, the guava, the pumpkin and squash, the papaw and the<br>
pineapple, indigenous to North America, had been under cultivation here<br>
before Columbus came, the first four from most ancient times. The manioc<br>
or tapioca-plant, the red-pepper plant, the marmalade plum, and the<br>
tomato were raised in South America before 1500.&nbsp; The persimmon,
the<br>
cinchona tree, millet, the Virginia and the Chili strawberry are natives<br>
of this continent, but have been brought under cultivation only within<br>
the last three centuries.<br>
<br>
The four great cereals, wheat, rye, oats, and rice, constituting all our<br>
main food crops but corn, have come to us from Europe. So have cherries,<br>
quinces, and pears, also hops, currants, chestnuts, and mushrooms. The<br>
banana, regarded by von Humboldt as an original American fruit, modern<br>
botanists derive from Asia. With reference to apples there may be some<br>
question. Apples of a certain kind flourished in New England so early<br>
after the landing of the Pilgrims that it is difficult to suppose the<br>
fruit not to have been indigenous to this continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Champlain, in<br>
1605 or 1606, found the Indians about the present sites of Portland,<br>
Boston, and Plymouth in considerable agricultural prosperity, with<br>
fields of corn and tobacco, gardens rich in melons, squashes, pumpkins,<br>
and beans, the culture of none of which had they apparently learned from<br>
white men. Mr. Payne's generalization, that superior food-supply<br>
occasioned the Old World's primacy in civilization, and also that of the<br>
Mexicans and Peruvians here, seems too sweeping, yet it evidently<br>
contains large truth.<br>

DISCOVERY AND SETTLEMENT<br>
<br>
1492-1660<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
COLUMBUS<br>
<br>
[1000]<br>
<br>
There is no end to the accounts of alleged discoveries of America before<br>
Columbus. Most of these are fables. It is, indeed, nearly certain that<br>
hardy Basque, Breton, and Norman fishermen, adventuring first far north,<br>
then west, had sighted Greenland and Labrador and become well acquainted<br>
with the rich fishing-grounds about Newfoundland and the Saint Lawrence<br>
Gulf. Many early charts of these regions, without dates and hitherto<br>
referred to Portuguese navigators of a time so late as 1500, are now<br>
thought to be the work of these earlier voyagers. They found the New<br>
World, but considered it a part of the Old.<br>
<br>
Important, too, is the story of supposed Norse sea-rovers hither,<br>
derived from certain Icelandic manuscripts of the fourteenth century. It<br>
is a pleasing narrative, that of Lief Ericson's sail in 1000-1001 to<br>
Helluland, Markland, and at last to Vineland, and of the subsequent<br>
tours by Thorwald Ericson in 1002, Thorfinn Karlsefne, 1007-1009, and of<br>
Helge and Finnborge in 1011, to points still farther away. Such voyages<br>
probably occurred. As is well known, Helluland has been interpreted to<br>
be Newfoundland; Markland, Nova Scotia; and Vineland, the country<br>
bordering Mount Hope Bay in Bristol, R. I. These identifications are<br>
possibly correct, and even if they are mistaken, Vineland may still have<br>
been somewhere upon the coast of what is now the United States.<br>
<br>
In the present condition of the evidence, however, we have to doubt<br>
this. No scholar longer believes that the writing on Dighton Rock is<br>
Norse, or that the celebrated Skeleton in Armor found at Fall River was<br>
a Northman's, or that the old Stone Mill at Newport was constructed by<br>
men from Iceland. Even if the manuscripts, composed between three and<br>
four hundred years after the events which they are alleged to narrate,<br>
are genuine, and if the statements contained in them are true, the<br>
latter are far too indefinite to let us be sure that they are applicable<br>
to United States localities.<br>
<br>

<br>
But were we to go so far as to admit that the Northmen came here and<br>
began the settlements ascribed to them, they certainly neither<br>
appreciated nor published their exploits. Their colony, wherever it was,<br>
endured but for a day, and it, with its locality, speedily passed from<br>
knowledge in Scandinavia itself. America had not yet, in effect, been<br>
discovered.<br>

<br>
[1300]<br>
<br>
We must remember that long anterior to Columbus's day unbiassed and<br>
thoughtful men had come to believe the earth to be round. They also knew<br>
that Europe constituted but a small part of it. In the year 1260 the<br>
Venetian brothers Niccolo and Maffeo Polo made their way to China, the<br>
first men from Western Europe ever to travel so far. They returned in<br>
1269, but in 1271 set out again, accompanied by Niccolo's son, a youth<br>
of seventeen. This son was the famous Marco Polo, whose work, "The<br>
Wonders of the World," reciting his extended journeys through China and<br>
the extreme east and southeast of Asia, and his eventful voyage home by<br>
sea, ending in 1295, has come down to our time, one of the most<br>
interesting volumes in the world. Friar Orderic's eastern travels in<br>
1322-1330, as appropriated by Sir John Mandeville, were published before<br>
1371.<br>
<br>
Columbus knew these writings, and the reading and re-reading of them had<br>
made him an enthusiast. In Polo's book he had learned of Mangi and Far<br>
Cathay, with their thousands of gorgeous cities, the meanest finer than<br>
any then in Europe; of their abounding mines pouring forth infinite<br>
wealth, their noble rivers, happy populations, curious arts, and benign<br>
government. Polo had told him of Cambalu (Peking), winter residence of<br>
the Great Khan, Kublai--Cambalu with its palaces of marble,<br>
golden-roofed, its guard of ten thousand soldiers, its imperial stables<br>
containing five thousand elephants, its unnumbered army, navy, and<br>
merchant marine; of oxen huge as elephants; of richest spices, nuts<br>
large as melons, canes fifteen yards long, silks, cambrics, and the<br>
choicest furs; and of magic Cipango (Japan), island of pearls, whose<br>
streets were paved with gold.<br>
<br>

</big></big><big><big>[1456]<br>
<br>
Columbus believed all this, and it cooperated with his intense and even<br>
bigoted religious faith to kindle in him an all-consuming ambition to<br>
reach this distant Eden by sea, that he might carry the Gospel to those<br>
opulent heathen and partake their unbounded temporal riches in return.<br>
Poor specimen of a saint as Columbus is now known to have been, he<br>
believed himself divinely called to this grand enterprise.<br>
<br>
Christopher Columbus, or Christobal Colon, as he always signed himself<br>
after he entered the service of Spain, was born in Genoa about 1456.<br>
Little is certainly known of his early life. His father was a humble<br>
wool-carder. The youth possessed but a sorry education, spite of his few<br>
months at the University of Pavia. At the age of fourteen he became a<br>
sailor, knocking about the world in the roughest manner, half the time<br>
practically a pirate. In an all-day's sea fight, once, his ship took<br>
fire and he had to leap overboard; but being a strong swimmer he swam,<br>
aided by an oar, eight leagues to land.<br>
<br>
[1470]<br>
<br>
From 1470 to 1484 we find him in Portugal, the country most interested<br>
and engaged then in ocean-going and discovery. Here he must have known<br>
Martin Behem, author of the famous globe, finished in 1492, whereon Asia<br>
is exhibited as reaching far into the same hemisphere with Europe.<br>
Prince Henry of Portugal earnestly patronized all schemes for<br>
exploration and discovery, and the daughter, Philippa, of one of his<br>
captains, Perestrello, Columbus married. With her he lived at Porto<br>
Santo in the Madeiras, where he became familiar with Correo, her<br>
sister's husband, also a distinguished navigator. The islanders fully<br>
believed in the existence of lands in the western Atlantic. West winds<br>
had brought to them strange woods curiously carved, huge cane-brakes<br>
like those of India described by Ptolemy, peculiarly fashioned canoes,<br>
and corpses with skin of a hue unknown to Europe or Africa.<br>

<big><big>Prince Henry of Portugal--"The Navigator." From an old print<br>
<br>
[1475-1484]<br>
<br>
Reflecting on these things, studying Perestrello's and Correo's charts<br>
and accounts of their voyages, corresponding with Toscanelli and other<br>
savans, himself an adept in drawing maps and sea-charts, for a time his<br>
occupation in Lisbon, cruising here and there, once far northward to<br>
Iceland, and talking with navigators from every Atlantic port, Columbus<br>
became acquainted with the best geographical science of his time.<br>
<br>
This had convinced him that India could be reached by sailing westward.<br>
The theoretical possibility of so doing was of course admitted by all<br>
who held the earth to be a sphere, but most regarded it practically<br>
impossible, in the then condition of navigation, to sail the necessary<br>
distance. Columbus considered the earth far smaller than was usually<br>
thought, a belief which we find hinted at so early as 1447, upon the<br>
famous mappe-Monde of the Pitti Palace in Florence, whereon Europe<br>
appears projected far round to the northwest. Columbus seems to have<br>
viewed this extension as a sort of yoke joining India to Scandinavia by<br>
the north. He judged that Asia, or at least Cipango, stretched<br>
two-thirds of the way to Europe, India being twice as near westward as<br>
eastward. Thirty or forty days he deemed sufficient for making it.<br>
Toscanelli and Behem as well as he held this belief; he dared boldly to<br>
act upon it.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/048Pic600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Queen Isabella of Spain.<br>
<br>
But to do so required resources. There are indications that Columbus at<br>
some time, perhaps more than once, urged his scheme upon Genoa and<br>
Venice. If so it was in vain. Nor can we tell whether such an attempt,<br>
if made, was earlier or later than his plea before the court of<br>
Portugal, for this cannot be dated. The latter was probably in 1484.<br>
King John II. was impressed, and referred Columbus's scheme to a council<br>
of his wisest advisers, who denounced it as visionary. Hence in 1485 or<br>
1486 Columbus proceeded to Spain to lay his project before Ferdinand and<br>
Isabella.<br>
<br>
On the way he stopped at a Franciscan convent near Palos, begging bread<br>
for himself and son. The Superior, Marchena, became interested in him,<br>
and so did one of the Pinzons--famous navigators of Palos. The king and<br>
queen were at the time holding court at Cordova, and thither Columbus<br>
went, fortified with a recommendation from Marchena. The monarchs were<br>
engrossed in the final conquest of Granada, and Columbus had to wait<br>
through six weary and heart-sickening years before royal attention was<br>
turned to his cause. It must have been during this delay that he<br>
despatched his brother Bartholomew to England with an appeal to Henry<br>
VII. Christopher had brought Alexander Geraldinus, the scholar, and also<br>
the Archbishop of Toledo, to espouse his mission, and finally, at the<br>
latter's instance, Ferdinand, as John of Portugal had done, went so far<br>
as to convene, at Salamanca, a council of reputed scholars to pass<br>
judgment upon Columbus and his proposition.&nbsp; By these, as by the<br>
Portuguese, he was declared a misguided enthusiast. They were too much<br>
behind the age even to admit the spherical figure of the earth.<br>
According to Scripture, they said, the earth is flat, adding that it was<br>
contrary to reason for men to walk heads downward, or snow and rain to<br>
ascend, or trees to grow with their roots upward.<br>
<br>

<br>
[1484-1492]<br>
<br>
The war for Granada ended, Santangel and others of his converts at court<br>
secured Columbus an interview with Isabella, but his demands seeming to<br>
her arrogant, he was dismissed. Nothing daunted, the hero had started<br>
for France, there to plead as he had pleaded in Portugal and Spain<br>
already, when to his joy a messenger overtook him with orders to come<br>
once more before the queen.<br>
<br>
Fuller thought and argument had convinced this eminent woman that the<br>
experiment urged by Columbus ought to be tried and a contract was soon<br>
concluded, by which, on condition that he should bear one-eighth the<br>
expense of the expedition, the public chest of Castile was to furnish<br>
the remainder. The story of the crown jewels having been pledged for<br>
this purpose is now discredited. If such pledging occurred, it was<br>
earlier, in prosecuting the war with the Moors. The whole sum needed for<br>
the voyage was about fifty thousand dollars. Columbus was made admiral,<br>
also viceroy of whatever lands should be discovered, and he was to have<br>
ten per cent of all the revenues from such lands. For his contribution<br>
to the outfit he was indebted to the Pinzons.<br>
<br>
This arrangement was made in April or May, 1492, and on the third of the<br>
next August, after the utmost difficulty in shipping crews for this sail<br>
into the sea of darkness, Columbus put out from Palos with one hundred<br>
and twenty men, on three ships. These were the Santa Maria, the Nina,<br>
and the Pinta. The largest, the Santa Maria, was of not over one hundred<br>
tons, having a deck-length of sixty-three feet, a keel of fifty-one<br>
feet, a draft of ten feet six inches, and her mast-head sixty feet above<br>
sea-level. She probably had four anchors, with hemp cables.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/053Pic600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Embarkation of Christopher Columbus at Palos. From an old
print.<br>
<br>
From Palos they first bore southward to the Canary Islands, into the<br>
track of the prevalent east winds, then headed west, for Cipango, as<br>
Columbus supposed, but really toward the northern part of Florida. When<br>
a little beyond what he regarded the longitude of Cipango, noticing the<br>
flight of birds to the southwest, he was induced to follow these, which<br>
accident made his landfall occur at Guanahani (San Salvador), in the<br>
Bahamas, instead of the Florida coast.<br>
<br>
Near midnight, between October 11th and 12th, Columbus, being on the<br>
watch, descried a light ahead. About two o'clock on the morning of the<br>
12th the lookout on the Pinta distinctly saw land through the moonlight.<br>
When it was day they went on shore. The 12th of October, 1492,<br>
therefore, was the date on which for the first time, so far as history<br>
attests with assurance, a European foot pressed the soil of this<br>
continent. Adding nine days to this to translate it into New Style, we<br>
have October 21st as the day answering to that on which Columbus first<br>
became sure that his long toil and watching had not been in vain.<br>
<br>
[1493-1500]<br>
<br>
The admiral having failed to note its latitude and longitude, it is not<br>
known which of the Bahamas was the San Salvador of Columbus, whether<br>
Grand Turk Island, Cat (the present San Salvador), Watling, Mariguana,<br>
Acklin, or Samana, though the last named well corresponds with his<br>
description. Mr. Justin Winsor, however, and with him a majority of the<br>
latest critics, believes that Watling's Island was the place. Before<br>
returning to Spain, Columbus discovered Cuba, and also Hayti or<br>
Espagnola (Hispaniola), on the latter of which islands he built a fort.<br>
<br>
In a second voyage, from Cadiz, 1493-1496, the great explorer discovered<br>
the Lesser Antilles and Jamaica. In a third, 1498-1500, he came upon<br>
Trinidad and the mainland of South America, at the mouth of the Orinoco.<br>
This was later by thirteen months and a week than the Cabots' landfall<br>
at Labrador or Nova Scotia, though a year before Amerigo Vespucci saw<br>
the coast of Brazil. It was during this third absence that Columbus,<br>
hated as an Italian and for his undeniable greed, was superseded by<br>
Bobadilla, who sent him and his brother home in chains. Soon free again,<br>
he sets off in 1502 upon a fourth cruise, in which he reaches the coast<br>
of Honduras.<br>
<br>
To the day of his death, however, the discoverer of America never<br>
suspected that he had brought to light a new continent. Even during this<br>
his last expedition he maintained that the coast he had touched was that<br>
of Mangi, contiguous to Cathay, and that nineteen days of travel<br>
overland would have taken him to the Ganges. He arrived in Spain on<br>
September 12, 1504, and died at Segovia on May 20th of the next year.<br>
His bones are believed to rest in the cathedral at Santo Domingo,<br>
transported thither in 1541, the Columbus-remains till recently at<br>
Havana being those of his son Diego. The latter, under the belief that<br>
they were the father's, were transferred to Genoa in 1887, and deposited<br>
there on July 2d of that year with the utmost ecclesiastical pomp.<br>
<br>
[1500-1507]<br>
<br>
As Columbus was ignorant of having found a new continent, so was he<br>
denied the honor of giving it a name, this falling by accident, design,<br>
or carelessness of truth, to Amerigo Vespucci, a native of Florence,<br>
whose active years were spent in Spain and Portugal. Vespucci made three<br>
voyages into the western seas. In the second, 1501, he visited the coast<br>
of Brazil, and pushed farther south than any navigator had yet done,<br>
probably so far as the island of South Georgia, in latitude 54 degrees.<br>
His account of this voyage found its way into print in 1504, at<br>
Augsburg, Germany, the first published narrative of any discovery of the<br>
mainland. Although, as above noted, it was not the earliest discovery of<br>
the main, it was widely regarded such, and caused Vespucci to be named<br>
for many years as the peer, if not the superior of Columbus. The<br>
publication ran through many editions. That of Strassburg, 1505,<br>
mentioned Vespucci on its title-page as having discovered a new<br>
"Southern Land." This is the earliest known utterance hinting at the<br>
continental nature of the new discovery, as separate from Asia, an idea<br>
which grew into a conviction only after Magellan's voyage, described in<br>
the next chapter. In 1507 appeared at St. Die, near Strassburg, a<br>
four-page pamphlet by one Lud, secretary to the Duke of Lorraine,<br>
describing Vespucci's voyages and speaking of the Indians as the<br>
"American race." This pamphlet came out the same year in another form,<br>
as part of a book entitled "Introduction to Cosmography," prepared by<br>
Martin Waldseemuller, under the nom de plume of "Hylacomylus." In this<br>
book the new "part of the world" is distinctly called "THE LAND OF<br>
AMERICUS, OR AMERICA," There is some evidence that Vespucci at least<br>
connived at the misapprehension which brought him his renown--as<br>
undeserved as it has become permanent--but this cannot be regarded as<br>
proved.<br>

CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
EARLY SPANISH AMERICA<br>
<br>
[1498]<br>
<br>
As we have seen, Spain by no means deserves the entire credit of<br>
bringing the western continent to men's knowledge. Columbus himself was<br>
an Italian. So was Marco Polo, his inspirer, and also Toscanelli, his<br>
instructor, by whose chart he sailed his ever-memorable voyage. To<br>
Portugal as well Columbus was much indebted, despite his rebuff there.<br>
Portugal then led the world in the art of navigation and in enthusiasm<br>
for discovery. Nor, probably, would Columbus have asked her aid in vain,<br>
had she not previously committed herself to the enterprise of reaching<br>
India eastward, a purpose brilliantly fulfilled when, in 1498, Vasco da<br>
Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and sailed to Calicut, on the coast<br>
of Malabar. Already before this Spain and Portugal were rivals in the<br>
search for new lands, and Pope Alexander VI. had had to be appealed to,<br>
to fix their fields. By his bull of May 3, 4, 1493, he ordained as the<br>
separating line the meridian passing through a point one hundred leagues<br>
west of the Azores, where Columbus had observed the needle of his<br>
compass to point without deflection toward the north star. Portugal<br>
objecting to this boundary as excluding her from the longitude of the<br>
newly found Indies, by the treaty of Tordesillas, June 7, 1494, the two<br>
powers, with the Pope's assent, moved the line two hundred and seventy<br>
leagues still farther west. At this time neither party dreamed of the<br>
complications destined subsequently to arise in reference to the<br>
position of this meridian on the other side of the globe.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/063Pic600e.jpg" alt=""><br>

<br>
The meridian of the Tordesillas convention had been supposed still to<br>
give Spain all the American discoveries likely to be made, it being<br>
ascertained only later that by it Portugal had obtained a considerable<br>
part of the South American mainland Brazil, we know, was, till in 1822<br>
it became independent, a Portuguese dependency. Spain, however, retained<br>
both groups of the Antilles with the entire main about the Gulf of<br>
Mexico, and became the earliest great principality in the western world.<br>
<br>
[1506-1513]<br>
<br>
Before the death of Columbus, Spain had taken firm possession of Cuba,<br>
Porto Rico, and St. Domingo, and she stood ready to seize any of the<br>
adjoining islands or lands so soon as gold, pearls, or aught else of<br>
value should be found there. Cruises of discovery were made in every<br>
direction, first, indeed, in Central and South America. In 1506 de Solis<br>
sailed along the eastern coast of Yucatan. In 1513 the governor of a<br>
colony on the Isthmus of Darien, Vasco Nunez de Balboa, from the top of<br>
a lofty mountain on the isthmus, saw what is now called the Pacific<br>
Ocean. He designated it the South Sea, a name which it habitually bore<br>
till far into the eighteenth century. From this time the exploration and<br>
settlement of the western coast, both up and down, went on with little<br>
interruption, but this history, somewhat foreign to our theme, we cannot<br>
detail.<br>

<br>
The same year, 1513, Ponce de Leon, an old Spanish soldier in the wars<br>
with the Moors, a companion of Columbus in his second voyage, and till<br>
now governor of Porto Rico, began exploration to the northward. Leaving<br>
Porto Rico with three ships, he landed on the coast of an unknown<br>
country, where he thought to find not only infinite gold but also the<br>
much-talked-about fountain of perpetual youth. His landing occurred on<br>
Easter Sunday, or Pascua Florida, March 27, 1513, and so he named the<br>
country Florida. The place was a few miles north of the present town of<br>
St. Augustine. Exploring the coast around the southern extremity of the<br>
peninsula, he sailed among a group of islands, which he designated the<br>
Tortugas. Returning to Porto Rico, he was appointed governor of the new<br>
country. He made a second voyage, was attacked by the natives and<br>
mortally wounded, and returned to Cuba to die.<br>
<br>
[1518-1520]<br>
<br>
Juan de Grijalva explored the south coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from<br>
Yucatan toward the Panuco. Interest attaches to this enterprise mainly<br>
because the treasure which Grijalva collected aroused the envy and greed<br>
of the future conqueror of Mexico, Hernando Cortez.<br>
<br>
In 1518, Velasquez, governor of Cuba, sends Cortez westward, with eleven<br>
ships and over six hundred men, for the purpose of exploration. He<br>
landed at Tabasco, thence proceeded to the Island of San Juan de Ulua,<br>
nearly opposite Vera Cruz, where he received messengers and gifts from<br>
the Emperor Montezuma. Ordered to leave the country, he destroyed his<br>
ships and marched directly upon the capital. He seized Montezuma and<br>
held him as a hostage for the peaceable conduct of his subjects. The<br>
Mexicans took up arms, only to be defeated again and again by the<br>
Spaniards. Montezuma became a vassal of the Spanish crown, and<br>
covenanted to pay annual tribute. Attempting to reconcile his people to<br>
this agreement he was himself assailed and wounded, and, refusing all<br>
nourishment, soon after died. With re-enforcements, Cortez completed<br>
the conquest of the country, and Mexico became a province of Spain.<br>

<br>
Vasquez de Ayllon, one of the auditors of the Island of Santo Domingo,<br>
sent two ships from that island to the Bahamas for Indians to be sold as<br>
slaves. Driven from their course by the wind, they at length reached the<br>
shore of South Carolina, at the mouth of the Wateree River, which they<br>
named the Jordan, calling the country Chicora. Though kindly treated by<br>
the natives, the ruthless adventurers carried away some seventy of<br>
these. One ship was lost, and most of the captives on the others died<br>
during the voyage. Vasquez was, by the Emperor Charles V., King of<br>
Spain, made governor of this new province, and again set sail to take<br>
possession. But the natives, in revenge for the cruel treatment which<br>
they had previously received, made a furious attack upon the invaders.<br>
The few survivors of the slaughter returned to Santo Domingo, and the<br>
expedition was abandoned. These voyages were in 1520 and 1526.<br>
<br>
In connection with the subject of Spanish voyages, a passing notice<br>
should be given to one, who, though not of Spanish birth, yet did much<br>
to further the progress of discovery on the part of his adopted country.<br>
Magellan was a Portuguese navigator who had been a child when Columbus<br>
came back in triumph from the West Indies. Refused consideration from<br>
King Emmanuel, of Portugal, for a wound received under his flag during<br>
the war against Morocco, he renounced his native land and offered his<br>
services to the sagacious Charles V., of Spain, who gladly accepted<br>
them, With a magnificent fleet, Magellan, in 1519, set sail from<br>
Seville, cherishing Columbus's bold purpose, which no one had yet<br>
realized, of reaching the East Indies by a westward voyage, After<br>
touching at the Canaries, he explored the coast of South America, passed<br>
through the strait now called by his name, discovered the Ladrone<br>
Islands, and christened the circumjacent ocean the Pacific.<br>
</big></big><big><big><br>
</big></big><big><big>The illustrious navigator now sailed for the
Philippine
Islands, so<br>
named from Philip, son of Charles V., who succeeded that monarch as<br>
Philip II. By the Tordesillas division above described, the islands were<br>
properly in the Portuguese hemisphere, but on the earliest maps, made by<br>
Spaniards, they were placed twenty-five degrees too far east, and this<br>
circumstance, whether accidental or designed, has preserved them to<br>
Spain even to the present time. At the Philippine Islands Magellan was<br>
killed in an affray with the natives. One of his ships, the Victoria,<br>
after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, arrived in Spain, having<br>
been the first to circumnavigate the globe. The voyage had taken three<br>
years and twenty-eight days.<br>
<br>
[1528-1540]<br>
<br>
The disastrous failure of the expedition of Vasquez de Ayllon to Florida<br>
did not discourage attempts on the part of others in the same direction.<br>
Velaspuez, governor of Cuba, jealous of the success of Cortez in Mexico,<br>
had sent Pamphilo de Narvaez to arrest him. In this attempt Narvaez had<br>
been defeated and taken prisoner. Undeterred by this failure he had<br>
solicited and received of Charles V. the position of governor over<br>
Florida, a territory at that time embracing the whole southern part of<br>
what is now the United States, and reaching from Cape Sable to the<br>
Panuco, or River of Palms, in Mexico. With three hundred men he, in<br>
1528, landed near Appalachee Bay, and marched inland with the hope of<br>
opening a country rich and populous. Bitterly was he disappointed.<br>
Swamps and forests, wretched wigwams with their squalid inmates<br>
everywhere met his view, but no gold was to be found. Discouraged, he<br>
and his followers returned to the coast, where almost superhuman toil<br>
and skill enabled them to build five boats, in which they hoped to work<br>
westward to the Spanish settlements. Embarking, they stole cautiously<br>
along the coast for some distance, but were at last driven by a storm<br>
upon an island, perhaps Galveston, perhaps Santa Rosa, where Narvaez and<br>
most of his men perished. Four of his followers survived to cross Texas<br>
to the Gulf of California and reach the town of San Miguel on the west<br>
coast of Mexico. Here they found their countrymen, searching as usual<br>
for pearls, gold, and slaves, and by their help they made a speedy<br>
return to Spain, heroes of as remarkable an adventure as history<br>
records. These unfortunates were the first Europeans to visit New<br>
Mexico. Their narrative led to the exploration of that country by<br>
Coronado and others, and to the discoveries of Cortez in Lower<br>
California.<br>

<big><big>Ferdinand de Soto.<br>
<br>
Ferdinand de Soto, eager to rival the exploits of Cortez in Mexico, and<br>
of his former commander, Pizarro, in Peru, offered to conquer Florida at<br>
his own expense. Appointed governor-general of Florida and of Cuba, he<br>
sailed with seven large and three small vessels. From Espiritu Santo Bay<br>
he, in 1539, marched with six hundred men into the country of the<br>
Appalachians and discovered the harbor of Pensacola. After wintering at<br>
Appalachee he set out into the interior, said to abound in gold and<br>
silver. Penetrating northeasterly as far as the Savannah, he found only<br>
copper and mica. From here he marched first northwest into northern<br>
central Georgia, then southwest into Alabama. A battle was fought with<br>
the natives at Mavila, or Mobile, in which the Spaniards suffered<br>
serious loss. Ships that he had ordered arrived at Pensacola, but de<br>
Soto determined not to embark until success should have crowned his<br>
efforts. He turned back into the interior, into the country of the<br>
Chickasaws, marched diagonally over the present State of Mississippi to<br>
its northwest corner, and crossed the Mississippi River near the lowest<br>
Chickasaw Bluff. From this point the general direction of the Spanish<br>
progress was southwest, through what is now Arkansas, past the site of<br>
Little Rock, till at last a river which seems to have been the Washita<br>
was reached. Down this stream de Soto and his decimated force<br>
floated--two hundred and fifty of his men had succumbed to the hardships<br>
and perils of his march--arriving at the junction of the Red with the<br>
Mississippi River on Sunday, April 17, 1542. At this point de Soto<br>
sickened and died, turning over the command to Luis de Moscoso. Burying<br>
their late leader's corpse at night deep in the bosom of the great<br>
river, and constructing themselves boats, the survivors of this<br>
ill-fated expedition, now reduced to three hundred and seventy-two<br>
persons, made the best of their way down the Mississippi to the Gulf,<br>
and along its coast, finally reaching the Spanish town near the mouth of<br>
the Panuco in Mexico.<br>

Thus no settlement had as yet been made in Florida by the Spanish. The<br>
first occupation destined to be permanent was brought about through<br>
religious jealousy inspired by the establishment of a French Protestant<br>
(Huguenot) colony in the territory. Ribault, a French captain<br>
commissioned by Charles IX., was put in command of an expedition by that<br>
famous Huguenot, Admiral Coligny, and landed on the coast of Florida, at<br>
the mouth of the St. John's, which he called the River of May. This was<br>
in 1562. The name Carolina, which that section still bears, was given to<br>
a fort at Port Royal, or St. Helena. Ribault returned to France, where<br>
civil war was then raging between the Catholics and the Protestants or<br>
Huguenots. His colony, waiting for promised aid and foolishly making no<br>
attempt to cultivate the soil, soon languished. Dissensions arose, and<br>
an effort was made to return home. Famine having carried off the greater<br>
number, the colony came to an end. In 1564 Coligny sent out Laudonniere,<br>
who built another fort, also named Carolina, on the River of May. Again<br>
misfortunes gathered thickly about the settlers, when Ribault arrived<br>
bringing supplies.<br>

<big><big>Pedro Melendez.<br>
<br>
But Spain claimed this territory, and Pedro Melendez a Spanish soldier,<br>
was in 1565 sent by Philip II. to conquer it from the French, doubly<br>
detested as Protestants. He landed in the harbor and at the mouth of the<br>
river, to both of which he gave the name St. Augustine. Melendez lost no<br>
time in attacking Fort Carolina, which he surprised, putting the<br>
garrison mercilessly to the sword. The destruction of the French colony<br>
was soon after avenged by Dominic de Gourgues, who sailed from France to<br>
punish the enemies of his country. Having accomplished his purpose by<br>
the slaughter of the Spanish garrison he returned home, but the French<br>
Protestants made no further effort to colonize Florida.<br>
<br>
Spain claimed the land by right of discovery, but, although maintaining<br>
the feeble settlement at St. Augustine, did next to nothing after this<br>
to explore or civilize this portion of America. The nation that had sent<br>
out Columbus was not destined to be permanently the great power of the<br>
New World. The hap of first landing upon the Antilles, and also the warm<br>
climate and the peaceable nature of the aborigines, led Spain to fix her<br>
settlements in latitudes that were too low for the best health and the<br>
greatest energy. Most of the settlers were of a wretched class,<br>
criminals and adventurers, and they soon mixed largely with the natives.<br>
Spain herself greatly lacked in vigor, partly from national causes,<br>
partly from those obscure general causes which even to this day keep<br>
Latin Europe, in military power and political accomplishments, inferior<br>
to Teutonic or Germanic Europe.<br>

<br>
Moreover, the Spaniards found their first American conquests too easy,<br>
and the rewards of these too great. This prevented all thought of<br>
developing the country through industry, concentrating expectation<br>
solely upon waiting fortunes, to be had from the natives by the sword or<br>
through forced labor in mines, Their treatment of the aborigines was<br>
nothing short of diabolical. Well has it been said: "The Spaniards had<br>
sown desolation, havoc, and misery in and around their track. They had<br>
depopulated some of the best peopled of the islands and renewed them<br>
with victims deported from others. They had inflicted upon hundreds of<br>
thousands of the natives all the forms and agonies of fiendish cruelty,<br>
driving them to self-starvation and suicide, as a way of mercy and<br>
release from an utterly wretched existence. They had come to be viewed<br>
by their victims as fiends of hate, malignity, and all dark and cruel<br>
desperation and mercilessness in passion. The hell which they denounced<br>
upon their victims was shorn of its worst terror by the assurance that<br>
these tormentors were not to be there. Las Casas, the noble missionary,<br>
the true soldier of the cross, and the few priests and monks who<br>
sympathized with him, in vain protested against these cruelties."<br>
<br>
To all these causes we must add the narrow colonial policy of Spain.<br>
Imitating Venice and ancient Carthage instead of Greece, she held her<br>
dependencies under the straitest servitude to herself as conquered<br>
provinces, repressing all political or commercial independence. A<br>
similar restrictive policy, indeed, hampered the colonies of other<br>
nations, but it was nowhere else so irrational or blighting as in<br>
Spanish America.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
EXPLORATION AND COLONIZATION BY THE FRENCH AND THE ENGLISH<br>
<br>
[1534]<br>
<br>
How the French fought for foothold in Florida and were routed by the<br>
Spaniards has just been related. So early as 1504, and possibly much<br>
earlier, before Cabot or Columbus, French sailors were familiar with the<br>
fisheries of Newfoundland. To the Isle of Cape Breton they gave its name<br>
in remembrance of their own Brittany. The attention of the French<br>
Government was thus early directed toward America, and it at length<br>
determined to share in the new discoveries along with the Spanish and<br>
the English.<br>
<br>
In 1524 Verrazano, a Florentine navigator, was sent by Francis I. on a<br>
voyage of discovery to the New World. Sighting the shores of America<br>
near the present Wilmington, North Carolina, he explored the coast of<br>
New Jersey, touched land near New York Bay, and anchored a few days in<br>
the harbor of Newport. In this vicinity he came upon an island, which<br>
was probably Block Island. Sailing from here along the coast as far<br>
north as Newfoundland, he named this vast territory New France.<br>

<big><big>Jacques Cartier. From an old print.<br>
<br>
[1540]<br>
<br>
In 1534 Cartier, a noted voyager of St. Malo, coasted along the north of<br>
Newfoundland, passed through the Straits of Belle Isle into the water<br>
now known as St. Lawrence Gulf, and into the mouth of the St. Lawrence<br>
River. Erecting a cross, he took possession of the shores in the name of<br>
the king of France.<br>
<br>
In the following year he made a second voyage, going up as far as the<br>
mouth of a small river which the year before he had named St. John's. He<br>
called the waters the Bay of St. Lawrence. Ascending this, he came to a<br>
settlement of the natives near a certain hill, which he called Mont<br>
Royal, now modified into "Montreal." Cartier returned to France in 1536,<br>
only a few of his men having survived the winter.<br>
<br>
In 1540 Lord Roberval fitted out a fleet, with Cartier as subordinate.<br>
Cartier sailed at once--his third voyage--Roberval following the next<br>
year. A fort was built near the present site of Quebec. Roberval and<br>
Cartier disagreed and returned to France, leaving the real foundation of<br>
Quebec to be laid by Champlain, much later.<br>
<br>
In 1604 De Monts arrived on the coast of Nova Scotia and erected a fort<br>
at the mouth of the St. Croix, New Brunswick. He also made a settlement<br>
on the shore of the present harbor of Annapolis, naming it Port Royal,<br>
and the country around it Acadia. De Monts is famous largely because<br>
under him the Sieur de Champlain, the real father of French colonization<br>
in America, began his illustrious career. He had entered the St.<br>
Lawrence in 1603. In 1608 he founded Quebec, the first permanent colony<br>
of New France. The next year he explored the lake which perpetuates his<br>
name. In 1615 he saw Lake Huron, Le Caron, the Franciscan, preceding him<br>
in this only by a few days. Fired with ardor for discovery, Champlain<br>
joined the Hurons in an attack upon the Iroquois. This led him into what<br>
is now New York State, but whether the Indian camp first attacked by him<br>
was on Onondaga or on Canandaigua Lake is still in debate. These were<br>
but the beginning of Champlain's travels, by which many other Frenchmen,<br>
some as missionaries, some as traders, were inspired to press far out<br>
into the then unknown West. We shall resume the narrative in Chapter VII<br>
of the next period. Champlain died at Quebec in 1635.<br>
<br>
Turn back now to Columbus's time. England, destined to dominate the<br>
continent of North America, was also practically the discoverer of the<br>
same. On St. John's day, June 24, 1497, thirteen months and a week<br>
before Columbus saw South America, John Cabot, a Venetian in the service<br>
of King Henry VII., from the deck of the good ship Matthew, of Bristol,<br>
descried land somewhere on the coast either of Labrador or of Nova<br>
Scotia. Cabot, of course, supposed this prima vista of his to belong to<br>
Asia, and expected to reach Cipango next voyage. So late as 1543 Jean<br>
Allefonsce, on reaching New England, took it for the border of Tartary.<br>
Andre Thevet, in 1515, in a pretended voyage to Maine, places Cape<br>
Breton on the west coast of Asia.&nbsp; This confusion probably
explains the<br>
tradition of Norumbega as a great city, and of other populous and<br>
wealthy cities in the newly found land. Men transferred ideas of Eastern<br>
Asia to this American shore.<br>
<br>
[1516]<br>
<br>
</big></big><big><big>The subsequent year Cabot made a second voyage,
inspecting the American<br>
coast northward till icebergs were met, southward to the vicinity of<br>
Albemarle Sound. Possibly in his first expedition, probably in the<br>
second, John Cabot was accompanied by his more famous son, Sebastian.<br>
For many years after the Cabots, England made little effort to explore<br>
the New World. Henry VII. was a Catholic. He therefore submitted to the<br>
Pope's bull which gave America to Spain. Henry VIII. had married<br>
Catherine of Aragon. He allowed Ferdinand, her father, to employ the<br>
skill and daring of Sebastian Cabot in behalf of Spain. It was reserved<br>
for the splendid reign of Elizabeth to show what English courage and<br>
endurance could accomplish in extending England's power.<br>

<br>
Like those before him, Martin Frobisher was in earnest to find the<br>
northwest passage, in whose existence all navigators then fully<br>
believed. Like Columbus, he vainly sought friends to aid him. At last,<br>
after he had waited fifteen years in vain, Dudley, the Earl of Warwick,<br>
helped him to an outfit. His little fleet embraced the Gabriel, of<br>
thirty-five tons, the Michael of thirty, and a pinnace of ten. As it<br>
swept to sea past Greenwich, the Queen waved her hand in token of<br>
good-will. Sailing northward near the Shetland Isles, Frobisher passed<br>
the southern shore of Greenland and came in sight of Labrador, 1576.<br>
<br>
He effected a landing at Hall's Island, at the mouth of the bay now<br>
called by his name, but which he thought to be a strait, his discovery<br>
thus strengthening his belief in the possibility of reaching Asia by<br>
this westward course. He sailed up the bay as far as Butcher's Island,<br>
where five of his men were taken prisoners by the natives. All effort to<br>
rescue them was made, but to no purpose. Among the curiosities which he<br>
brought home was a piece of stone, or black ore, which gave rise to the<br>
belief that gold was to be found in this new country.<br>
<br>
[1577]<br>
<br>
A second and larger expedition sailed in 1577. The Queen gave 1,000<br>
pounds and lent the royal ship Aid, of two hundred tons. The Gabriel and<br>
the Michael of the former year were again made ready, besides smaller<br>
craft. This voyage was to seek gold rather than to discover the<br>
northwest passage. The fleet set sail May 27th, and on July 18th arrived<br>
off North Foreland, or Hall's Island, so named for the man who had<br>
brought away the piece of black earth. Search was made for this metal,<br>
supposed to be so valuable, and large quantities were found. The fleet<br>
sailed back to England with a heavy cargo of it.<br>
<br>
In 1578 a third and the last voyage was made to this region, to which<br>
the name meta incognita was given. Two large ships were furnished by the<br>
Queen, and these were accompanied by thirteen smaller ones.<br>
<br>
[1578-1580]<br>
<br>
It was now the purpose to found a colony. The expedition set sail May<br>
31st, going through the English Channel, and reaching the coast of<br>
Greenland June 21st. Frobisher and a few of his sailors landed where,<br>
perhaps, white men had never trodden before. As he came near the bay he<br>
was driven south by stormy weather, and entered, not knowing his<br>
whereabouts, the waters of Hudson's Straits, which he traversed a<br>
distance of sixty miles. He succeeded at length in retracing his course,<br>
and anchored on the southern shore of Frobisher's Bay, in the Countess<br>
of Warwick's Sound. But the desire for gold, the bleak winds, barren<br>
shores, and drifting icebergs, all combined to dispel the hopes of<br>
making a successful settlement, and the adventurers turned their faces<br>
homeward, carrying once more a cargo of ore, which proved, like the<br>
first, to be of no value whatever.<br>
<br>
Almost three hundred years later Captain Hall, the American explorer,<br>
visited the Countess's Island and Sound. Among the Eskimos, from 1860 to<br>
1862, he learned the tradition of Frobisher's visits, which had been<br>
preserved and handed down. They knew the number of ships; they spoke of<br>
the three times that white men had come; how five of these strangers had<br>
been taken captive, and how, after remaining through the winter, they<br>
had been allowed to build a boat, and to launch themselves upon the icy<br>
seas, never to be heard of more. Captain Hall was shown many relics of<br>
Frobisher's voyages, some of which he sent to the Royal Geographical<br>
Society of London, a part to the Smithsonian Institute at Washington.<br>
The small English house of lime and stone on this island was still<br>
standing in good condition, and there was also a trench where they had<br>
built their ill-fated boat.<br>

A contemporary of Frobisher, Sir Francis Drake, also entertained the<br>
idea of making the northwest passage. While engaged in privateering or<br>
piratical expeditions against the Spanish, Drake landed on the Isthmus<br>
of Panama, saw the Pacific for the first time, and determined to enter<br>
it by the Straits of Magellan. In 1577 he made his way through the<br>
straits, plundered the Spanish along the coast of Chili and Peru, and<br>
sailed as far north as the 48th parallel, or Oregon, calling the country<br>
New Albion. Steering homeward by the Cape of Good Hope, he arrived at<br>
Plymouth, his starting-point, in 1580, having been absent about two<br>
years and ten months.<br>

Thomas Cavendish had been with Grenville in the voyage of 1585 to<br>
Virginia. Frobisher's attempts inspired him with the ambition of the<br>
age. In 1586 he, too, sailed through the Straits of Magellan, burning<br>
and plundering Spanish ships, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and reached<br>
Plymouth in 1588, having been gone about two years and fifty days.<br>

<br>
These half-piratical attempts against Spain led continually into<br>
American waters, till the notion of forming a permanent outpost here as<br>
base for such adventures suggested to Sir Humphrey Gilbert the plan,<br>
which he failed to realize, of founding an American settlement. Gilbert<br>
visited our shores in 1579, and again in 1583, but was lost on his<br>
return from the latter voyage.<br>
<br>
In 1584 Sir Walter Raleigh sent two captains, Amidas and Barlow, to<br>
inspect the coast off what is now North Carolina. They reported so<br>
favorably that he began, next year, a colony on Roanoke Island. England<br>
was now a Protestant land, and no longer heeded Spanish claims to the<br>
transatlantic continent, save so far as actual settlements had been<br>
made.<br>
<br>
[1586]<br>
<br>
Sir Richard Grenville commanded this expedition, but was to return on<br>
seeing the one hundred and eight colonists who accompanied him well<br>
established. Queen Elizabeth gave the name VIRGINIA to the new country.<br>
Drake, tending homeward from one of his raids on the Spanish coast, in<br>
1586, offered the settlers supplies, but finding them wholly<br>
discouraged, he carried them back to England.<br>

Determined to plant an agricultural community, Raleigh next time, l587,<br>
sent men with their families. A daughter to one of these, named Dare,<br>
was the first child of English parents born in America. Becoming<br>
destitute, the colony despatched its governor home for supplies. He<br>
returned to find the settlement deserted, and no tidings as to the fate<br>
of the poor colonists have ever been heard from that day to our own. The<br>
Jamestown settlers mentioned in the next chapter found among their<br>
Indian neighbors a boy whose whitish complexion and wavy hair induced<br>
the interesting suspicion that he was descended from some one of these<br>
lost colonists of Roanoke.<br>
<br>
Thus Sir Walter's enterprise had to be abandoned. In the 40,000 pounds<br>
spent upon it his means were exhausted. Besides, England was now at war<br>
with Spain, and the entire energies of the nation were in requisition<br>
for the overthrow of the Spanish Armada.<br>

CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
THE PLANTING OF VIRGINIA<br>
<br>
[1606]<br>
<br>
We have now arrived at the seventeenth century. In 1606 King James I.<br>
issued the first English colonial charter. It created a first and a<br>
second Virginia Company, the one having its centre in London, and coming<br>
to be known as the London Company; the other made up of Bristol, Exeter,<br>
and Plymouth men, and gradually taking the title of the Plymouth<br>
Company. This latter company, the second, or Plymouth Company,<br>
authorized to plant between 38 degrees and 45 degrees north, effected a<br>
settlement in 1607 at the mouth of the Kennebec River. Little came of it<br>
but suffering, the colonists, after a severe winter, returning to<br>
England.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/115Pic_600E.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>King James I. Mr. Henry Irving's Collection.<br>
<br>
[1607]<br>
<br>
A colony of one hundred and five planters sent out by the first or<br>
London Company, proceeded, also in 1607, to Chesapeake Bay, entering<br>
James River, to which they indeed gave this name, and planted upon its<br>
banks Jamestown, the first permanent English colony on the continent.<br>
This London Company consisted of a council in England, appointed by the<br>
king, having the power to name the members of a local council which was<br>
to govern the colony, the colonists themselves having no voice.<br>
<br>
It is well known that the very earliest population of the Old Dominion<br>
was not of the highest, but predominantly idle and thriftless. Vagabonds<br>
and homeless children picked up in the streets of London, as well as<br>
some convicts, were sent to the colony from England to be indented as<br>
servants, permanently, or for a term of years. Persons of the better<br>
class, to be sure, came as well, and the quality of the population, on<br>
the whole, improved year by year. Settlement here followed a centrifugal<br>
tendency, except as this was repressed by fear of the Indians. In 1616<br>
the departments of Virginia were Henrico, up the James above the<br>
Appomattox mouth, West and Shirley Hundreds, Jamestown, Kiquoton, and<br>
King's Gift on the coast near Cape Charles--a wide reach of territory to<br>
be covered by a total population of only three hundred and fifty.<br>
<br>
[1608]<br>
<br>
A little exporting was immediately begun. So early as May 20, 1608,<br>
Jamestown sent to England a ship laden with iron ore, sassafras, cedar<br>
posts, and walnut boards. Another followed on June 2d, with a cargo all<br>
of cedar wood. This year or the next, small quantities of pitch, tar,<br>
and glass were sent. From 1619 tobacco was so common as to be the<br>
currency. About 1650 it was largely exported, a million and a half<br>
pounds, on the average, yearly. The figure had risen to twelve million<br>
pounds by 1670. At the middle of the century, corn, wheat, rice, hemp,<br>
flax, and fifteen varieties of fruit, as well as excellent wine were<br>
produced. A wind-mill was set up about 1620, the first in America. It<br>
stood at Falling Creek on the James River. The pioneer iron works on the<br>
continent were in this colony, hailing from about the date last named.<br>
Community of property prevailed at Jamestown in all the earliest years,<br>
as it did at Plymouth. After the event noted by John Rolfe: "about the<br>
last of August [1619] came in a Dutch man of warre that sold us twenty<br>
Negars," slavery was a continual and increasing curse, as is attested<br>
by the laws concerning slaves. It encouraged indolence and savagery of<br>
habit and nature. Virginian slaves, however, were better treated than<br>
those farther south. They were tolerably clothed, fed, and housed.<br>

Captain John Smith.<br>
<br>
There was in Virginia little of that healthful social and political<br>
contact which did so much to develop civilization at the North. Of town<br>
life there was practically nothing. Even so late as 1716 Jamestown had<br>
only a sorry half-dozen structures, two of which were church and<br>
court-house. Fifteen years later Fredericksburg had, besides the manor<br>
house of Colonel Willis and its belongings, only a store, a tailor shop,<br>
a blacksmith shop, a tavern or "ordinary," and a coffeehouse. Richmond<br>
and Petersburg still existed only on paper, and if we come down to the<br>
middle of the eighteenth century, Williamsburg, the capital of the<br>
province, was nothing but a straggling village of two hundred houses,<br>
without a single paved street. Only the College and the governor's<br>
"palace" were of brick. The county-seats were mostly mere glades in the<br>
woods, containing each its court-house, prison, whipping-post, pillory,<br>
and ducking-stool, besides the wretched tavern where court and<br>
attendants put up, and possibly a church. Hardships and dissensions<br>
marked the whole early history of this infant state. At one time only<br>
forty settlers remained alive, at another meal and water were the sole<br>
diet. Hoping for instant riches in gold, poor gentlemen and vagabonds<br>
had come, too much to the exclusion of mechanics and laborers. For<br>
relief from the turbulence and external dangers of this period, the<br>
colony owed much to Captain John Smith, who, after all allowance for his<br>
boasting, certainly displayed great courage and energy in emergencies.<br>
He, too, it was who did most to explore the country up the James and<br>
upon Chesapeake Bay.<br>

<br>
[1609-1610]<br>
<br>
A new charter was granted in 1609, the council in England being now<br>
appointed by the stockholders instead of the king, and the governor of<br>
the colony being named by this council. Lord Delaware was made Governor<br>
and Captain-General of Virginia, and many more colonists sent out. By a<br>
wreck of two of the vessels there was delay in the arrival of the newly<br>
chosen officers. Smith, then Percy, meantime continued to exercise<br>
authority. This, again, was a critical period. Indians were troublesome.<br>
Tillage having been neglected from the first, provisions became<br>
exhausted, and a crisis long referred to as "the starving time" ensued.<br>
The colony had actually abandoned Jamestown and shipped for England,<br>
when met in James River by Lord Delaware, coming with relief. They at<br>
once returned, and an era of hope dawned. This was in June, 1610. One<br>
hundred and fifty new settlers accompanied Delaware. Planting was<br>
vigorously prosecuted, the Indians placated, and still further<br>
accessions of people and cattle secured from England.<br>
<br>
[1612]<br>
<br>
Delaware's brief, mild sway was always a benediction, in pleasing<br>
contrast with the severities of Dale and Argall, who successively<br>
governed after his departure. Under Dale, death was the penalty for<br>
slaughtering cattle, even one's own, except with the Governor's leave,<br>
also of exporting goods without permission. A baker giving short weight<br>
was to lose his ears, and on second repetition to suffer death. A<br>
laundress purloining linen was to be flogged. Martial law alone<br>
prevailed; even capital punishment was ordained without jury. Such<br>
arbitrary rule was perhaps necessary, so lawless were the mass of the<br>
population. It at any rate had the excellent effect of rousing the<br>
Virginians to political thought and to the assertion of their rights. In<br>
1612 a change took place in the Company's methods of governing its<br>
colony. The superior council was abolished, its authority transferred to<br>
the corporation as a whole, which met as an assembly to elect officers<br>
and enact laws for the colony. The government thus became more<br>
democratic in form and spirit.<br>

[1614-1619]<br>
<br>
The year 1614 was distinguished by the marriage of Pocahontas, daughter<br>
of the native chief Powhatan, to the English colonist Rolfe. With him<br>
she visited England, dying there a few years later. The alliance secured<br>
the valuable friendship of Powhatan and his subjects--only till<br>
Powhatan's death, however. Thenceforth savage hostilities occurred at<br>
frequent intervals. In 1622 they were peculiarly severe, over three<br>
hundred settlers losing their lives through them. Another outbreak took<br>
place about 1650, this time more quickly suppressed. We shall see in a<br>
later chapter how Bacon's Rebellion was occasioned by Indian troubles.<br>
<br>
As James I. broke with Parliament, a majority of the Virginia<br>
shareholders proved Liberals, and they wrought with signal purpose and<br>
effect to realize their ideas in their colony. To this political<br>
complexion of the Virginia Company not only Virginia itself, but, in a<br>
way, all America is indebted for a start toward free institutions.<br>
During the governorship of George Yeardley, was summoned an assembly of<br>
burgesses, consisting of two representatives, elected by the<br>
inhabitants, from each of the eleven boroughs or districts which the<br>
colony had by this time come to embrace. It met on June 10, 1619, the<br>
earliest legislative body in the New World. This was the dawn of another<br>
new era in the colony's history.<br>
<br>

[1622-1625]<br>
<br>
In 1622 arrived Sir Thomas Wyatt, bringing a written constitution from<br>
the Company, which confirmed to the colony representative government and<br>
trial by jury. The assembly was given authority to make laws, subject<br>
only to the Governor's veto. This enlargement of political rights was<br>
due to the growth of the sentiment of popular liberty in England. In the<br>
meetings of the London Company debates were frequent and spirited<br>
between the court faction and the supporters of the political rights of<br>
the colonists. James I., dissatisfied with the authority which he had<br>
himself granted, appointed a commission to inquire into the Company's<br>
management, and also into the circumstances of the colony. A change was<br>
recommended, the courts decided as the king wished, and the Company was<br>
dissolved, The colony, while still allowed to govern itself by means of<br>
its popular assembly, was thus brought directly under the supervision of<br>
the Crown. Charles I., coming to the throne in 1625, gave heed to the<br>
affairs of the colony only so far as necessary to secure for himself the<br>
profits of the tobacco trade, It was doubtless owing to his indifference<br>
that the colony continued to enjoy civil freedom. He again appointed<br>
Yeardley Governor, a choice agreeable to the people; and in 1628, by<br>
asking that the assembly be called in order to vote him a monopoly of<br>
the coveted trade, he explicitly recognized the legitimacy and authority<br>
of that body.<br>
<br>
[1642]<br>
<br>
Yeardley was succeeded by Harvey, who rendered himself unpopular by<br>
defending in all land disputes the claims arising under royal grant<br>
against those based upon occupancy. Difficulties of this sort pervaded<br>
all colonial history.<br>
<br>
In 1639 Wyatt held the office, succeeded in 1642 by Berkeley, during<br>
whose administration the colony attained its highest prosperity.<br>
Virginians now possessed constitutional rights and privileges in even a<br>
higher degree than Englishmen in the northern colonies. The colonists<br>
were most loyal to the king, and were let alone. They were also attached<br>
to the Church of England, ever manifesting toward those of a different<br>
faith the spirit of intolerance characteristic of the age.<br>
<br>
[1650]<br>
<br>
During the civil war in England, Virginia, of course, sided with the<br>
king. When Cromwell had assumed the reins of government he sent an<br>
expedition to require the submission of the colony. An agreement was<br>
made by which the authority of Parliament was acknowledged, while the<br>
colony in return was left unmolested in the management of its own<br>
affairs.<br>

CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
PILGRIM AND PURITAN AT THE NORTH<br>
<br>
[1612]<br>
<br>
The Pilgrims who settled New England were Independents, peculiar in<br>
their ecclesiastical tenet that the single congregation of godly<br>
persons, however few or humble, regularly organized for Christ's work,<br>
is of right, by divine appointment, the highest ecclesiastical authority<br>
on earth. A church of this order existed in London by 1568; another,<br>
possibly more than one, the "Brownists," by 1580. Barrowe and Greenwood<br>
began a third in 1588, which, its founders being executed, went exiled<br>
to Amsterdam in 1593, subsequently uniting with the Presbyterians there.<br>
These churches, though independent, were not strictly democratic, like<br>
those next to be named.<br>
<br>
Soon after 1600 John Smyth gathered a church at Gainsborough in<br>
Lincolnshire, England, which persecution likewise drove to Amsterdam.<br>
Here Smyth seceded and founded a Baptist church, which, returning to<br>
London in 1611 or 1612, became the first church of its kind known to<br>
have existed in England. From Smyth's church at Gainsborough sprang one<br>
at Scrooby, in Nottinghamshire, and this, too, exiled like its parent,<br>
crossed to Holland, finding home in Leyden in 1607 and 1608. Of this<br>
church John Robinson was pastor, and from its bosom came the Plymouth<br>
Colony to New England.<br>

<br>
This little band set out for America with a patent from the Virginia<br>
Company, according to James I.'s charter of 1606, but actually began<br>
here as labor-share holders in a sub-corporation of a new organization,<br>
the Plymouth Company, chartered in 1620. Launching in the Mayflower from<br>
Plymouth, where they had paused in their way hither from Holland, they<br>
arrived off the coast of Cape Cod in 1620, December 11th Old Style,<br>
December 21st New Style, and began a settlement, to which they gave the<br>
name Plymouth. Before landing they had formed themselves into a<br>
political body, a government of the people with "just and equal laws."<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/134Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>The Life of the Colony at Cape Cod.<br>
<br>
They based their civil authority upon this Mayflower compact,<br>
practically ignoring England. Carver was the first governor, Bradford<br>
the second. The colony was named Plymouth in memory of hospitalities<br>
which its members had received at Plymouth, England, the name having no<br>
connection with the "Plymouth" of the Plymouth Company. The members of<br>
the Plymouth Company had none but a mercantile interest in the<br>
adventure, merely fitting out the colonists and bearing the expense of<br>
the passage for all but the first. On the other hand, the stock was not<br>
all retained in England. Shares were allotted to the Pilgrims as well,<br>
one to each emigrant with or without means, and one for every 10 pounds<br>
invested.<br>
<br>
Plymouth early made a treaty with Massasoit, the chief of the<br>
neighboring Wampanoags, the peace lasting with benign effects to both<br>
parties for fifty years, or till the outbreak of Philip's War, discussed<br>
in a later chapter. The first winter in Plymouth was one of dreadful<br>
hardships, of famine, disease and death, which spring relieved but in<br>
part. Yet Plymouth grew, surely if slowly. It acquired rights on the<br>
Kennebec, on the Connecticut, at Cape Ann. It was at first a pure<br>
democracy, its laws all made in mass-meetings of the entire body of<br>
male inhabitants; nor was it till 1639 that increase of numbers forced<br>
resort to the principle of representation. In 1643 the population was<br>
about three thousand.<br>

[1626-1630]<br>
<br>
Between 1620 and 1630 there were isolated settlers along the whole New<br>
England coast. White, a minister from Dorchester, England, founded a<br>
colony near Cape Ann, which removed to Salem in 1626. The Plymouth<br>
Company granted them a patent, which Endicott, in charge of more<br>
emigrants, brought over in 1628. It gave title to all land between the<br>
Merrimac and Charles Rivers, also to all within three miles beyond each.<br>
These men formed the nucleus of the colony to which in 1629 Charles I.<br>
granted a royal charter, styling the proprietors "the Governor and<br>
Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England." Boston was made the<br>
capital. Soon more emigrants came, and Charlestown was settled.<br>
<br>

<br>
It was a momentous step when the government of this colony was<br>
transferred to New England. Winthrop was chosen Governor, others of the<br>
Company elected to minor offices, and they, with no fewer than one<br>
thousand new colonists, sailed for this side the Atlantic. In<br>
Massachusetts, therefore, a trading company did not beget, as elsewhere,<br>
but literally became a political state. Many of the Massachusetts men,<br>
in contrast with those of Plymouth, had enjoyed high consideration at<br>
home. Yet democracy prevailed here too. The Governor and his eighteen<br>
assistants were chosen by the freemen, and were both legislature and<br>
court. As population increased and scattered in towns, these chose<br>
deputies to represent them, and a lower house element was added to the<br>
General Court, though assistants and deputies did not sit separately<br>
till 1644.<br>

At this time Massachusetts had a population of about 15,000. To all New<br>
England 21,200 emigrants came between 1628 and 1643, the total white<br>
population at the latter date being about 24,000.<br>

<br>
So early as 1631 this colony decreed to admit none as freemen who were<br>
not also church members. Thus Church and State were made one, the<br>
government a theocracy. The Massachusetts settlers, though in many<br>
things less extreme than the Pilgrims, were decided Puritans, sincere<br>
but formal, precise, narrow, and very superstitious. They did not,<br>
however, on coming hither, affect or wish to separate from the Church of<br>
England, earnestly as they deprecated retaining the sign of the cross in<br>
baptism, the surplice, marriage with ring, and kneeling at communion.<br>
Yet soon they in effect became Separatists as well as Puritans, building<br>
independent churches, like those at Plymouth, and repudiating episcopacy<br>
utterly.<br>
<br>

<br>
Much as these Puritans professed and tried to exalt reason in certain<br>
matters, in civil and religious affairs, where they took the Old<br>
Testament as affording literal and minute directions for all sorts of<br>
human actions for all time, they could allow little liberty of opinion.<br>
This was apparent when into this theocratic state came Roger Williams,<br>
afterward the founder of Rhode Island. Born in London, England, about<br>
1607, of good family, he was placed by his patron, Coke, at the Charter<br>
House School. From there he went to Pembroke College, Cambridge. In 1631<br>
he arrived in Boston. Somewhat finical in his political, moral, and<br>
religious ideas, he found it impossible, having separated from the<br>
Church of England, in which he had been reared, to harmonize here with<br>
those still favoring that communion. At Salem he was invited by a little<br>
company of Separatists to become their teacher. His views soon offended<br>
the authorities. He declared that the king's patent could confer no<br>
title to lands possessed by Indians. He denied the right of magistrates<br>
to punish heresy, or to enforce attendance upon religious services. "The<br>
magistrate's power," he said, "extends only to the bodies, goods, and<br>
outward state of men."<br>
<br>
Alarmed at his bold utterances, the General Court of Massachusetts,<br>
September 2, 1635, decreed his banishment for "new and dangerous<br>
opinions, against the authority of magistrates." His fate was not,<br>
therefore, merely because of his religious views. The exile sought<br>
refuge at Seekonk, but this being within the Plymouth jurisdiction, he,<br>
on Governor Winslow's admonition, moved farther into the wilderness,<br>
settling at Providence. He purchased land of the natives, and, joined by<br>
others, set up a pure democracy, instituting as a part thereof the<br>
"lively experiment," for which ages had waited, of perfect liberty in<br>
matters of religious belief. Not for the first time in history, but more<br>
clearly, earnestly, and consistently than it had ever been done before,<br>
he maintained for every man the right of absolute freedom in matters of<br>
conscience, for all forms of faith equal toleration.<br>

Some friends of Mrs. Anne Hutchinson established a colony on Aquidneck,<br>
the Indian name for Rhode Island. Williams went to England and secured<br>
from Parliament a patent which united that plantation with his in one<br>
government. Charles II.'s charter of 1663 added Warwick to the first two<br>
settlements, renewing and enlarging the patent, and giving freest scope<br>
for government according to Williams' ideas. Mrs. Hutchinson, a woman of<br>
rare intellect and eloquence, who maintained the right of private<br>
judgment and pretended to an infallible inner light of revelation, was,<br>
like Williams, a victim of Puritan intolerance. She and her followers<br>
were banished, and some of them, returning, put to death, 1659-60. She<br>
came to Providence, then went to Aquidneck, where her husband died in<br>
1642. She next settled near Hurl Gate, within the Dutch limits, where<br>
herself and almost her entire family were butchered by the Indians in<br>
1643.<br>
<br>
In 1633 the Dutch erected a fort where Hartford now is, but some English<br>
emigrants from Plymouth Colony, in defiance of a threatened cannonade,<br>
sailed past and built a trading-house at Windsor, where, joined by<br>
colonists, from about Boston, they soon effected a settlement.<br>
Wethersfield and Hartford were presently founded. In 1630 the Plymouth<br>
Company had granted Connecticut to the Earl of Warwick, who turned it<br>
over to Lord Brooke, Lord Say-and-Seal, and others. Winthrop the<br>
Younger, son of Governor Winthrop, of Massachusetts, commissioned by<br>
these last, built a fort at Saybrook. Till the expiration of his<br>
commission the towns immediately upon the Connecticut were under the<br>
government of Massachusetts. Their population in 1643 was three<br>
thousand. A convention of these towns met at Hartford, January 14, 1639,<br>
and formed a constitution, like that of Massachusetts Bay, thoroughly<br>
republican in nature. Connecticut breathed a freer spirit than either<br>
Massachusetts or New Haven, being in this respect the peer of Plymouth.<br>
At Hartford Roger Williams was always welcome.<br>
<br>
Meantime, in 1638, having touched at Boston the year before, Davenport,<br>
Eaton, and others from London began planting at New Haven. The Bible was<br>
adopted as their guide in both civil and religious affairs, and a<br>
government organized in which only church members could vote or be<br>
elected to the General Court. The colony flourished, branching out into<br>
several towns. In 1643 it numbered twenty five hundred inhabitants.<br>
<br>
As early as 1622, Mason and Gorges were granted land partly in what is<br>
now Maine, partly in what is now New Hampshire; and in 1623 Dover and<br>
Portsmouth were settled. Wheelwright, a brother-in-law of Mrs.<br>
Hutchinson, with others, purchased of the natives the southeast part of<br>
New Hampshire, between the Merrimac and the Piscataqua, and in 1638<br>
Exeter was founded. In the same year with Wheelwright's purchase, Mason<br>
obtained from the council of the Plymouth Company a patent to this same<br>
section, and the tract was called New Hampshire. These conflicting<br>
claims paved the way for future controversies and lawsuits. The settlers<br>
here were not Puritans, nor were they obliged to be church members in<br>
order to be deputies or freemen.<br>
<br>
The settlement of Maine goes back to 1626, when the Plymouth Company<br>
granted lands there both to Alexander and to Gorges. In 1639 Gorges<br>
secured a royal charter to re-enforce his claim. Large freedom, civil<br>
and religious, was allowed. For many years the Maine settlements were<br>
small and scattered, made up mostly of such as came to hunt and fish for<br>
a season only.<br>
<br>
[1650]<br>
<br>
From 1643 to 1684 Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven<br>
formed a confederation under the style of the United Colonies of New<br>
England. Maine, Providence, and Rhode Island sought membership, but were<br>
refused as being civilly and religiously out of harmony with the<br>
colonies named. Connecticut, offensive to the Dutch, and exposed to<br>
hostilities from them, was the most earnest for the union, while at the<br>
same time the most conservative as to its form. It was a loose league,<br>
leaving each colony independent save as to war and peace, Indian<br>
affairs, alliances and boundaries. Questions pertaining to these were to<br>
be settled by a commission of two delegates from each of the four<br>
colonies, meeting yearly, voting man by man, six out of the eight votes<br>
being necessary to bind.<br>
<br>
The confederacy settled a boundary dispute between New Haven and New<br>
Netherland in 1650. It received and disbursed moneys, amounting some<br>
years to 600 pounds, for the propagation of the gospel in New England,<br>
sent over by the society which Parliament incorporated for that purpose<br>
in 1649. It was also of more or less service in securing united action<br>
against the savages in Philip's War. The union was, however, of little<br>
immediate service, useful rather as an example for the far future. Its<br>
failure was due partly to the distance of the colonies apart, and to the<br>
strength of the instinct for local self-government, a distinguishing<br>
political trait of New England till our day. Its main weakness, however,<br>
was the overbearing power and manner of Massachusetts, especially after<br>
her assumption of Maine in 1652. In 1653 the Plymouth, New Haven, and<br>
Connecticut commissioners earnestly wished war with New Netherland, but<br>
Massachusetts proudly forbade--a plain violation of the articles. After<br>
this there was not much heart in the alliance. The last meeting of the<br>
commissioners occurred at Hartford, September 5, 1684.<br>

CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
BALTIMORE AND HIS MARYLAND<br>
<br>
[1630]<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/150Pic_600BWe.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>&nbsp;
Maryland Shilling.<br>
<br>
The very year that witnessed the landing of the Pilgrims records the<br>
beginning of another attempt to colonize the New World. While Secretary<br>
of State, having been appointed in 1619, Sir George Calvert, a member of<br>
the Virginia Company from 1609 until its dissolution in 1624, determined<br>
to plant a colony for himself. In the memorable year 1620 he bought of<br>
Lord Vaughan the patent to the south-eastern peninsula of Newfoundland,<br>
the next he sent colonists thither with a generous supply of money for<br>
their support. In 1623 King James gave him a patent, making him<br>
proprietary of this region. In 1625 Calvert boldly declared himself a<br>
Catholic, and resigned his office of Secretary. Spite of this he was<br>
soon afterwards ennobled, and his new title of Lord Baltimore is the<br>
name by which he is best known. Visiting his little settlement in 1627<br>
he quickly came to the conclusion that the severity of the climate would<br>
make its failure certain. He therefore gave up this enterprise, but<br>
determined to repeat the attempt on the more favorable soil of Virginia.<br>
Confident of the goodwill of Charles I., to whom he had written for a<br>
grant of land there, he did not await a reply, but sailed for Virginia,<br>
where he arrived in 1629. In 1632 the king issued a patent granting to<br>
Baltimore and his heirs a territory north and east of the Potomac,<br>
comprising what we now call Maryland, all Delaware, and a part of<br>
Pennsylvania. The name Maryland was given it by the king in, honor of<br>
his queen, Henrietta Maria. But before this charter had received royal<br>
signature Lord Baltimore had breathed his last,&nbsp; and his son Cecil<br>
succeeded to his honors and possessions.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/152Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Henrietta Maria.<br>
<br>
The Maryland charter made the proprietary the absolute lord of the soil.<br>
He was merely to acknowledge fealty by the delivery of two Indian arrows<br>
yearly to the king at Windsor. He could make laws with the consent of<br>
the citizens, declare war or peace, appoint officers of government; in<br>
fact, in most respects he had regal power. The colonists were, however,<br>
to remain English subjects, with all the privileges of such. If they<br>
were not represented in Parliament, neither were they taxed by the<br>
Crown. If the proprietary made laws for them, these must not be contrary<br>
to the laws of England. And they were to enjoy freedom of trade, not<br>
only with England but with foreign countries.<br>
<br>
[1634-1635]<br>
<br>
This charter, as will be readily seen, could not please the Virginians,<br>
since the entire territory conveyed by it was part of the grant of 1609<br>
to the London Company for Virginia. But as this and subsequent charters<br>
had been annulled in 1624, the new colony was held by the Privy Council<br>
to have the law on its side, and Lord Baltimore was left to make his<br>
preparations undisturbed. He fitted out two vessels, the Ark and the<br>
Dove, and sent them on their voyage of colonization. They went by the<br>
way of the West Indies, arriving off Point Comfort in 1634. Sailing up<br>
the Potomac, they landed on the island of St. Clement's, and took formal<br>
possession of their new home. Calvert explored a river, now called the<br>
St. Mary's, a tributary of the Potomac, and being pleased with the spot<br>
began a settlement. He gained the friendship of the natives by<br>
purchasing the land and by treating them justly and humanely.<br>

<big><big>Clayborne's Trading Post on Kent Island.<br>
<br>
The proprietary was a Catholic, yet, whether or not by an agreement<br>
between him and the king, as Gardiner supposes, did not use either his<br>
influence or his authority to distress adherents of the Church of<br>
England. The two creeds stood practically upon an equality. But if<br>
religious troubles were avoided, difficulties of another sort were not<br>
slow in arising. About the year 1631, Clayborne, who had been secretary<br>
of the Virginia colony, had chosen Kent Island in Chesapeake Bay as a<br>
station for trading with the Indians. This post was in the very midst of<br>
Maryland, and Calvert notified Clayborne that he should consider it a<br>
part of that province. Clayborne at once showed himself a bitter enemy.<br>
The Indians became suspicious and unfriendly, Clayborne, so it was<br>
believed, being the instigator of this temper. An armed vessel was sent<br>
out, with orders from Clayborne to seize ships of the St. Mary's<br>
settlement. A fight took place, Clayborne fleeing to Virginia. Calvert<br>
demanded that he should be given up. This was refused, and in 1637 he<br>
went to England. A committee of the Privy Council decided that Kent<br>
Island belonged to Maryland.<br>
<br>
[1638]<br>
<br>
In 1635 the first Maryland assembly met, consisting of the freemen of<br>
the colony and the governor, Leonard Calvert, the proprietary's brother,<br>
who was presiding officer. Lord Baltimore repudiated its acts, on the<br>
ground that they were not proposed by him, as the charter directed. The<br>
assembly which gathered in 1638 retaliated, rejecting the laws brought<br>
forward by the proprietary.<br>
<br>
[1639]<br>
<br>
For a time the colony was without laws except the common law of England.<br>
But Baltimore was too wise and conciliatory to allow such a state of<br>
affairs to continue. He gave authority to the governor to assent to the<br>
acts of the assembly, which he himself might or might not confirm.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/157Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Fight between Clayborne and the St. Mary's Ship.<br>
<br>
Accordingly in 1639 the assembly met and passed various acts, mostly<br>
relating to civil affairs. One, however, was specially noteworthy, as<br>
giving to the "Holy Church" "her rights and liberties," meaning by this<br>
the Church of Rome, for, as Gardiner says, the title was never applied<br>
to the Church of England. It was at the same time expressly enacted that<br>
all the Christian inhabitants should be in the enjoyment of every right<br>
and privilege as free as the natural-born subjects of England. If Roger<br>
Williams was the first to proclaim absolute religious liberty, Lord<br>
Baltimore was hardly behind him in putting this into practice. As has<br>
been neatly said, "The Ark and the Dove were names of happy omen: the<br>
one saved from the general wreck the germs of political liberty, and the<br>
other bore the olive-branch of religious peace."<br>
<br>
[1646]<br>
<br>
During the civil war in England the affairs of Maryland were in a very<br>
disturbed condition. Clayborne, Maryland's evil genius, seized the<br>
opportunity to foment an insurrection, possessed himself once more of<br>
Kent Island, and compelled the governor to flee to Virginia. Returning<br>
in 1646, Calvert was fortunate enough to recover the reins of<br>
government, but the following year witnessed the close of his<br>
administration and his short though useful and eventful life. Few men<br>
intrusted with almost absolute authority have exercised it with so much<br>
firmness and at the same time with so much ability, discretion, and<br>
uprightness.<br>
<br>
[1650]<br>
<br>
His successor, Greene, a Catholic, was not likely to find favor with the<br>
Puritan Parliament of England, and Baltimore, in 1648, to conciliate the<br>
ruling powers and to refute the charge that Maryland was only a retreat<br>
for Romanists, removed the governor and appointed instead one who was a<br>
Protestant and a firm supporter of Parliament. The council was also<br>
changed so as to place the Catholics in the minority. The oath of the<br>
new governor restrained him from molesting any person, especially if of<br>
the Roman Catholic persuasion, on account of religious profession. The<br>
way was thus opened for the Act of Toleration passed in 1649. This law,<br>
after specifying certain speeches against the Trinity, the Virgin, or<br>
the saints as punishable offences, declared that equal privileges should<br>
be enjoyed by Christians of all creeds. Whatever the motives of<br>
Baltimore, his policy was certainly wise and commendable.<br>
<br>
A new and troublesome element was now introduced into the colony. Some<br>
Puritans who had not been tolerated among the stanch Church-of-England<br>
inhabitants of Virginia were invited by Governor Stone to Maryland.<br>
Their home here, which they named Providence, is now known as Annapolis.<br>
The new-comers objected to the oath of fidelity, refused to send<br>
burgesses to the assembly, and were ready to overthrow the government<br>
whose protection they were enjoying. Opportunity soon offered.<br>
Parliament had already in 1652 brought Virginia to submission. Maryland<br>
was now accused of disloyalty, and when we notice among the<br>
commissioners appointed by the Council of State, the name of Clayborne,<br>
it is not difficult to understand who was the author of this charge. The<br>
governor was removed, but being popular and not averse to compromise,<br>
was quickly restored. Then came the accession of Cromwell to power as<br>
Protector of England. Parliament was dissolved.&nbsp; The authority of
its<br>
commissioners of course ceased. Baltimore seized this opportunity to<br>
regain his position as proprietary. He bade Stone to require the oath of<br>
fidelity to the proprietary from those who occupied lands, and to issue<br>
all writs in his name. He maintained that the province now stood in the<br>
same relations to the Protectorate which it had borne to the royalist<br>
government of Charles I.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/161Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Oliver Cromwell.<br>
<br>
So thought Cromwell, but not so Clayborne or the Maryland Puritans. They<br>
deposed Stone, and put in power Fuller, who was in sympathy with their<br>
designs. There resulted a reversal of the acts of former assemblies, and<br>
legislation hostile to the Catholics. The new assembly, from which<br>
Catholics were carefully excluded by disfranchisement, at once repealed<br>
the Act of Toleration. Protection was withdrawn from those who professed<br>
the popish religion, and they were forbidden the exercise of that faith<br>
in the province. Severe penalties were threatened against "prelacy" and<br>
"licentiousness" thus restricting the benefits of their "Act concerning<br>
Religion" to the Puritan element now in power. The authority of the<br>
proprietary himself was disputed, and colonists were invited to take<br>
lands without his knowledge or consent.<br>
<br>
[1656]<br>
<br>
Baltimore adopted vigorous measures. By his orders Stone made a forcible<br>
attempt to regain control of the province, but was defeated at<br>
Providence and taken prisoner. His life was spared, but four of his men<br>
were condemned and executed. Baltimore again invoked the powerful<br>
intervention of Cromwell, and again were the enemies of Maryland sternly<br>
rebuked for their interference in the affairs of that province, and told<br>
in plain language to leave matters as they had found them. In 1656,<br>
after an inquiry by the Commissioners of Trade, the claims of Baltimore<br>
were admitted to be just, and he promptly sent his brother Philip to be<br>
a member of the council and secretary of the province. The legislation<br>
of the usurping Puritans was set aside, religious toleration once more<br>
had full sway, and a general pardon was proclaimed to those who had<br>
taken part in the late disturbances.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, Fendall, who had been appointed governor by Baltimore,<br>
plotted to make himself independent of his master, and, with the<br>
connivance of the assembly, proceeded to usurp the authority which was<br>
lawfully vested in the proprietary. But the attempt was a miserable<br>
failure.&nbsp; Philip Calvert was immediately made governor by the now<br>
all-powerful proprietary, who had the favor and support of Charles II.,<br>
just coming to the throne. Peace and prosperity came back to the colony<br>
so sorely and frequently vexed by civil dissensions. The laws were just<br>
and liberal, encouraging the advent of settlers of whatever creed, while<br>
the rule of the Calverts was wise and benign, such as to merit the<br>
respect and admiration of posterity. In 1643 Virginia and Maryland<br>
together had less than twenty thousand inhabitants. In 1660 Maryland<br>
alone, according to Fuller, had eight thousand. Chalmers thinks there<br>
were no fewer than twelve thousand at this date.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
NEW NETHERLAND<br>
<br>
[1609]<br>
<br>
While the French explorer, Champlain, was sailing along the shores of<br>
the lake which bears his name, another equally adventurous spirit, Henry<br>
Hudson, was on his way to the western world. Hoping to open a passage to<br>
India by a voyage to the north, Hudson, an English navigator, offered in<br>
1609 to sail under the authority of the Dutch East India Company. Driven<br>
back by ice and fog from a northeast course, he turned northwest.<br>
Searching up and down near the parallel of 40 degrees, he entered the<br>
mouth of the great river which perpetuates his name. He found the<br>
country inviting to the eye, and occupied by natives friendly in<br>
disposition. The subsequent career of this bold mariner has a mournful<br>
interest. He never returned to Holland, but, touching at Dartmouth, was<br>
restrained by the English authorities, and forbidden longer to employ<br>
his skill and experience for the benefit of the Dutch. Again entering<br>
the English service and sent once more to discover the northwest<br>
passage, he sailed into the waters of the bay which still bears his<br>
name, where cold and hunger transformed the silent discontent of his<br>
crew into open mutiny, and they left the fearless navigator to perish<br>
amid the icebergs of the frozen north.<br>

Hudson had sent to Holland a report of the Great River and the country<br>
bordering it, rich in fur-bearing animals, and it had excited eager<br>
interest. Private individuals sent expeditions thither and carried on a<br>
profitable trade with the natives. A few Dutch were here when, in 1613,<br>
Captain Argall sailed from Virginia against the French at Port Royal,<br>
Acadia, now Annapolis in Nova Scotia, who were encroaching upon the<br>
English possessions on the coast of Maine. He compelled them to<br>
surrender. On his return, he visited the Dutch traders of Manhattan<br>
Island, and forced them also, as it had been discovered by Cabot in<br>
1497, to acknowledge the sovereignty of England over this entire region.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/169Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Seal of New Netherland.<br>
<br>
It was in 1614 that the Dutch States-General, in the charter given to a<br>
company of merchants, named the Hudson Valley New Netherland. To<br>
facilitate trade this company made a treaty with the Five Nations and<br>
subordinate tribes, memorable as the first compact formed between the<br>
whites and the savages. In it the Indians were regarded as possessing<br>
equal rights and privileges with their white brethren. The treaty was<br>
renewed in 1645, and continued in force till the English occupation,<br>
1664. In 1618, the charter of the New Netherland Company having expired,<br>
the Dutch West India Company was offered a limited incorporation, but it<br>
was not until 1621 that it received its charter, and it was two years<br>
later that it was completely organized and approved by the<br>
States-General. By this company were sent out Mey, as Director, to the<br>
Delaware or South River, and Tienpont to the Hudson or North River. Four<br>
miles below Philadelphia Fort Nassau was erected, and where Albany now<br>
stands was begun the trading-post called Fort Orange.<br>
<br>
[1626]<br>
<br>
In 1626 Tienpont's successor, Peter Minuit, a German, born at Wesel, was<br>
appointed Director-General of New Netherland. He bought of the Indians,<br>
for the sum of twenty-four dollars, the entire island of Manhattan, and<br>
a fort called New Amsterdam was built. The State of New York dates its<br>
beginning from this transaction.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/171Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Earliest Picture of New Amsterdam.<br>
<br>
By their usually honest dealing with the natives the Dutch settlers<br>
gained the friendship of the Five Nations, whose good-will was partly on<br>
this account transferred to the English colonists later. The Dutch were<br>
not only friendly to the red men, but tried to open social and<br>
commercial relations with the Plymouth colonists as well. Governor<br>
Bradford replied, mildly urging the Dutch to "clear their title" to a<br>
territory which the English claimed by right of discovery.<br>

<big><big>De Vries.<br>
<br>
The present State of Delaware soon became the scene of attempts at<br>
settlement. De Vries began, in 1632, a colony on the banks of the<br>
Delaware, but it was quickly laid waste by the savages, who had been<br>
needlessly provoked by the insolence of the commander left in charge of<br>
the colony. In 1633 Minuit was succeeded by Van Twiller, and a fort was<br>
erected at Hartford, though the English claimed this country as theirs.<br>
Emigrants from the Plymouth colony began the settlement of Windsor, in<br>
spite of the protests of the Dutch. Long Island was invaded by<br>
enterprising New Englanders, regardless of the claim of New Netherland<br>
thereto.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/173Pic_e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Costumes of Swedes.<br>
<br>
This "irrepressible conflict" between two races was by no means abated<br>
by the introduction of a third. As early as 1626, Gustavus Adolphus,<br>
King of Sweden and the hero of the Thirty Years' War, had entertained<br>
the idea of establishing colonies in America, and in pursuance of that<br>
object had encouraged the formation of a company, not only for trading<br>
purposes but also to secure a refuge for the "oppressed of all<br>
Christendom." To Usselinx, an Antwerp merchant, the originator of the<br>
Dutch West India Company, belongs the honor of first suggesting to the<br>
king this enterprise. The glorious death of Gustavus on the victorious<br>
field of Lutzen in 1632 deferred the execution of a purpose which had<br>
not been forgotten even in the midst of that long and arduous campaign.<br>
But a few days before he fell, the Protestant hero had spoken of the<br>
colonial prospect as "the jewel of his kingdom."<br>
<br>
[1638]<br>
<br>
In 1638 Minuit, who had already figured as governor of New Netherland,<br>
having offered his services to Sweden, was intrusted with the leadership<br>
of the first Swedish colony to America. After a few days' stay at<br>
Jamestown the new-comers finally reached their wished-for destination on<br>
the west shore of the Delaware Bay and River. Proceeding up the latter,<br>
one of their first acts was to build a fort on a little stream about two<br>
miles from its junction with the Delaware, which they named Fort<br>
Christina, in honor of the young queen of Sweden. Near this spot stands<br>
the present city of Wilmington. The country from Cape Henlopen to the<br>
falls at Trenton received the title of New Sweden.<br>
<br>
[1650]<br>
<br>
It was in this very year that Kieft came to supersede Van Twiller, who<br>
had given just cause for complaint by his eagerness to enrich himself at<br>
the expense of the West India Company. During the administration of<br>
Kieft occurred the long and doubtful conflict with the natives detailed<br>
in the succeeding chapter. Arbitrary and exacting, he drove the Indians<br>
to extremities, and involved the Dutch settlements in a war which for a<br>
time threatened their destruction. Not till 1645 was peace<br>
re-established, and in 1647 the unpopular governor was recalled. In 1647<br>
not more than three hundred fighting men remained in the whole province.<br>
Its total population was between fifteen hundred and two thousand. In<br>
1652 New Amsterdam had a population of seven or eight hundred. In 1664<br>
Stuyvesant put the number in the province at ten thousand, about fifteen<br>
hundred of whom were in New Amsterdam.<br>

<br>
The next governor, Stuyvesant, was the last and much the ablest ruler<br>
among those who directed the destinies of New Netherland. His<br>
administration embraced a period of seventeen years, during which he<br>
renewed the former friendly relations with the savages, made a treaty<br>
with New England, giving up pretensions to Connecticut as well as<br>
relinquishing the east end of Long Island, and compelled the Swedes, in<br>
1655, to acknowledge the Dutch supremacy. It was while he was absent on<br>
his expedition against the Swedes, leaving New Amsterdam unprotected,<br>
that the river Indians, watchful of their opportunity, invaded and laid<br>
waste the surrounding country. In 1663 the savages attacked the village<br>
on the Esopus, now Kingston, and almost destroyed it. It was not until<br>
the energetic governor made a vigorous campaign against the Esopus<br>
tribe, whom he completely subdued, that peace was established on a firm<br>
footing.<br>

But the Dutch sway in their little part of the New World was about to<br>
end. The English had never given over their claim to the country by<br>
virtue of their first discovery of the North American continent. The New<br>
Netherlanders, tired of arbitrary rule, sighed for the larger freedom of<br>
their New England neighbors. Therefore, when in 1664 Charles II. granted<br>
to his brother, the Duke of York, the territory which the Dutch were<br>
occupying, and sent a fleet to demand its submission, the English<br>
invader was welcomed.<br>

<br>
Almost the only resistance came from the stout-hearted governor, who<br>
could hardly be dissuaded from fighting the English single-handed, and<br>
who signed the agreement to surrender only when his magistrates had, in<br>
spite of him, agreed to the proposed terms. But the founders of the<br>
Empire State have left an indelible impress upon the Union, which their<br>
descendants have helped to strengthen and perpetuate. They were honest,<br>
thrifty, devout, tolerant of the opinions of others. As Holland<br>
sheltered the English Puritans from ecclesiastical intolerance, so New<br>
Netherland welcomed within her borders the victims of New England<br>
bigotry and narrowness.<br>

<br>
CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
THE FIRST INDIAN WARS<br>
<br>
[1637]<br>
<br>
Troubles between the Indians and the whites arose so early as 1636. John<br>
Oldham was murdered on Block Island by a party of Pequot Indians. Vane<br>
of Massachusetts sent Endicott to inflict punishment. The Pequots in<br>
turn attacked the fort at Saybrook, and in 1637 threatened Wethersfield.<br>
They were planning a union with the Narragansets for the destruction of<br>
the English, when Roger Williams informed the Massachusetts colony of<br>
their designs and, at the urgent request of the governor and council,<br>
hastened to the chief of the Narragansets and dissuaded him from<br>
entering into the alliance.<br>
<br>
The moment was critical. Captain Mason with about ninety English and<br>
seventy Mohegans, under their sachem, Uncas (a sub chief, who with his<br>
district, Mohegan, had rebelled against the Pequot sachem, Sassacus),<br>
was sent from Hartford down the Connecticut River. Entering the Sound,<br>
he sailed past the mouth of the Thames and anchored in Narragansett Bay,<br>
at the foot of Tower Hill, near Point Judith. He knew that keen-eyed<br>
scouts from the Pequot stronghold on the west bank of the Mystic River,<br>
near Groton, had, as his three little ships skirted the shore, been<br>
watching him, to give warning of his approach. He therefore resolved to<br>
come upon the enemy from an unlooked-for quarter. This plan was directly<br>
contrary to his instructions, which required him to land at the mouth of<br>
the Thames and attack the fort from the west side. He hoped, marching<br>
westward across the country, to take the enemy by surprise on their<br>
unprotected rear, while the Indians, trusting in the strength of their<br>
fort, as it fronted the west, should believe themselves secure.<br>
<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/185C20pc.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Attack on the Fort of the Pequots on the Mystic River<br>
"The figure of the Indians fort or Palizado in NEW ENGLAND And the maner<br>
of the destroying It by Captayne Underhill and Captayne Manson"<br>
<br>
<br>
Thirteen men had been sent back to the Thames with the vessels. Two<br>
hundred Narragansets had joined the expedition, though their sachem,<br>
Miantonomoh, thought the English too weak to fight the dreaded Pequots.<br>
Mason's enterprise was admirably planned, and he was as fortunate as he<br>
was bold and skilful. He divided his men into two parties. One, led by<br>
Underhill, climbed the steep ascent on the south side of the Indian<br>
village; the other, directed by Mason himself, mounted the northern<br>
slope. The garrison was buried in slumber, made more profound by<br>
carousals the preceding night. One Indian was heard to cry out<br>
"Englishmen" before the volley of musketry from the attacking force told<br>
that the white enemy had come. Mason entered a wigwam and fought, as did<br>
the others, hand-to-hand with the now awakened and desperate foe. Coming<br>
out with a firebrand and exclaiming "We must burn them," he set fire to<br>
the wigwam. The flames were quickly carried through the fort by the<br>
northeast wind. Underhill from his side applied powder. So rapidly did<br>
the flames spread that the English had difficulty in making good their<br>
escape, while the Pequots who escaped the sword were doomed to perish by<br>
fire. In an hour's time from four hundred to six hundred had fallen,<br>
more than half of them women and children. Of the Englishmen two were<br>
killed and about twenty wounded. In this dreadful slaughter the<br>
Narragansets had little share, for they had shown such fear that Mason<br>
had said to Uncas, "Tell them not to fly, but stand at what distance<br>
they please and see whether Englishmen will now fight or not."<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/188Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Attack on the Pequot Fort.<br>
<br>
With the approach of day three hundred Pequots advanced from a second<br>
fort intending to fight, but they were struck with horror at the sight<br>
of their dead fellow-warriors. Keeping the enemy at bay, the English<br>
marched to the vessels, which had arrived at Pequot Harbor, and, placing<br>
the wounded on board, continued their march to Saybrook. The remnant of<br>
the Pequots sought to escape from the country, moving westward along the<br>
Sound. Captain Stoughton, sent with one hundred and twenty Massachusetts<br>
men, was guided by the Narragansets to a swamp in which a little band of<br>
those hostile savages had hidden. The men were slain, offering little<br>
resistance. The women and children were divided among the Indian allies<br>
or sold into slavery by the colonists of Massachusetts Bay.<br>
<br>
Mason and Stoughton together sailed from Saybrook along the shore, while<br>
Uncas with his men tracked the fugitives by land. At Guilford a Pequot<br>
sachem was entrapped, shot, and his head thrust into the crotch of an<br>
oak-tree near the harbor, giving the place the name of Sachem's Head.<br>
Near the town of Fairfield a last stand was made by the hunted redskins,<br>
in a swamp, to which the English were guided by a renegade Pequot. The<br>
tribe with whom the Pequots had taken shelter, also the women and<br>
children, were allowed to give themselves up. The men were shot down or<br>
broke through and escaped. The wife of Mononotto fell into the hands of<br>
the English. This Indian squaw had once shown kindness to two captive<br>
girls, and by Winthrop's orders she was kindly treated in return. The<br>
Pequots, once so powerful, were well-nigh exterminated. Those taken<br>
prisoners were spared only to be held in bondage, Mononotto's wife with<br>
the rest. Some were absorbed by the Narragansets, others by the<br>
Mohegans, while the settlers of Connecticut, upon whom the war had<br>
fallen so heavily, came into possession of the Pequot land.<br>
<br>
[l638]<br>
<br>
For nearly forty years the New England colonies were not again molested,<br>
the merciless vigor with which they had fought making a lasting<br>
impression upon their blood-thirsty foes. The cruel slavery to which the<br>
surviving natives were subjected, the English justified by the example<br>
of the Jews in their treatment of the Canaanites.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/190Pic.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Signature of Miantonomoh.<br>
<br>
[1642]<br>
<br>
The Narraganset chief, Miantonomoh, had become the friend and ally of<br>
the English by a treaty ratified in 1636, mainly through the good<br>
offices of Roger Williams, In 1638, after the destruction of the<br>
Pequots, there was a new treaty, embracing Uncas with his bold Mohegans,<br>
and stipulating that any quarrel between Miantonomoh and Uncas should be<br>
referred to the English. In 1642 Miantonomoh was accused of plotting<br>
against the English, and summoned before the General Court at Boston.<br>
Though acquitted he vowed revenge upon Uncas as the instigator of the<br>
charge. His friendship for Roger Williams, as also for Samuel Gorton,<br>
the purchaser of Shawomet, or Warwick, R. I., which was claimed by<br>
Massachusetts, had perhaps created a prejudice against him. At any rate,<br>
when a quarrel arose between Uncas and Sequasson, Miantonomoh's friend<br>
and ally, while the latter naturally sided with Sequasson, the<br>
sympathies of the English were with Uncas, who had aided them against<br>
the Pequots. With the consent of Connecticut and Massachusetts<br>
Miantonomoh took the field against Uncas, who had attacked Sequasson. He<br>
was defeated and taken prisoner. Carried to Hartford he was held to<br>
await the decision of the Commissioners of the United Colonies at<br>
Boston. They would not release him, yet had no valid ground for putting<br>
him to death. The case was referred to five clergymen, and they voted<br>
for his execution. For this purpose the commissioners gave orders to<br>
turn the brave warrior over to Uncas, English witnesses to be present<br>
and see that no cruelty was perpetrated. The sentence was carried into<br>
effect near Norwich. Cutting a piece of flesh from the shoulder of his<br>
murdered enemy, Uncas ate it with savage relish, declaring it to be the<br>
sweetest meat he had ever tasted.<br>

<br>
[1640-1643]<br>
<br>
The Dutch, too, as we have to some extent seen already, felt the horrors<br>
of Indian warfare. Kieft, the Dutch director-general, a man cruel,<br>
avaricious, and obstinate, angered the red men by demanding tribute from<br>
them as their protector, while he refused them guns or ammunition. The<br>
savages replied that they had to their own cost shown kindness to the<br>
Dutch when in need of food, but would not pay tribute. Kieft attacked.<br>
Some of the Indians were killed and their crops destroyed. This roused<br>
their revengeful passions to the utmost. The Raritan savages visited the<br>
colony of De Vries, on Staten Island, with death and devastation. Reward<br>
was offered for the head of anyone of the murderers. An Indian never<br>
forgot an injury. The nephew of one of the natives who twenty years<br>
before had been wantonly killed went to sell furs at Fort Amsterdam, and<br>
while there revenged his uncle's murder by the slaughter of an<br>
unoffending colonist. Spite of warlike preparations by Kieft and his<br>
assembly in 1641-42, the tribe would not give up the culprit. The<br>
following year another settler was knifed by a drunken Indian.&nbsp;
Wampum<br>
was indeed offered in atonement, while an indignant plea was urged by<br>
the savages against the liquor traffic, which demoralized their young<br>
men and rendered them dangerous alike to friend and foe. But<br>
remonstrance and blood-money could not satisfy Kieft. At Pavonia and at<br>
Corlaer's Hook [footnote: now in the New York City limits, just below<br>
Broadway Ferry, East River] the Dutch fell venomously upon the sleeping<br>
and unsuspecting enemy. Men, women, and children were slaughtered, none<br>
spared. In turn the tribes along the lower Hudson, to the number of<br>
eleven, united and desperately attacked the Dutch wherever found. Only<br>
near the walls of Fort Amsterdam was there safety. The governor<br>
appointed a day of fasting, which it seems was kept with effect. The<br>
sale of liquor to the red men was at last prohibited, and peace for a<br>
time secured.<br>
<br>
Soon, however, the redskins along the Hudson were again up in arms. The<br>
noted Underhill, who with Mason had been the scourge of the Pequots,<br>
came to the fight with fifty Englishmen as allies of the Dutch. Not<br>
waiting to be attacked, the Indians laid waste the settlements, even<br>
threatening Fort Amsterdam itself. At a place now known as Pelham Neck,<br>
near New Rochelle, lived the famous but unfortunate Mrs. Hutchinson, a<br>
fugitive from the persecuting zeal of Massachusetts. Here the implacable<br>
savages butchered her and her family in cold blood. Her little<br>
granddaughter alone was spared, and led captive to a far-off wigwam<br>
prison. Only at Gravesend, on Long Island, was a successful stand made,<br>
and that by a woman, Lady Deborah Moody, another exile from religious<br>
persecution, who with forty stout-hearted men defended her plantation<br>
and compelled the savages to beat a retreat.<br>
<br>
[1645]<br>
<br>
The colony was in extremity. New Haven refused to aid, because, as a<br>
member of the New England confederacy, it could not act alone, and<br>
because it was not satisfied that the Dutch war was just. An appeal was<br>
made by Kieft's eight advisers to both the States-General and the West<br>
India Company in Holland. The sad condition of the colonists was fully<br>
set forth, and the responsibility directly ascribed to the mismanagement<br>
of Kieft. At the same time, undismayed by the gloomy outlook, the<br>
courage of the sturdy Dutchmen rose with the emergency. Small parties<br>
were sent out against the Connecticut savages in the vicinity of<br>
Stamford. Indian villages on Long Island were surprised and the natives<br>
put to the sword. In two instances at least the victors disgraced<br>
humanity by torturing the captured.<br>
<br>
In these engagements Underhill was conspicuous and most energetic.<br>
Having made himself familiar with the position of the Indians near<br>
Stamford, he sailed from Manhattan with one hundred and fifty men,<br>
landed at Greenwich, and, marching all day, at midnight drew near the<br>
enemy. His approach was not wholly unannounced, for the moon was full.<br>
The fight was desperate and bloody. The tragedy that had made memorable<br>
the banks of the Mystic in the destruction of the Pequot fort was now<br>
almost equalled. After the example of his old comrade Mason, Underhill<br>
fired the village. By flame, shot, or sword more than five hundred human<br>
beings perished.<br>
<br>
While New Netherland was awaiting some message of cheer from Holland, a<br>
company of Dutch soldiers came from Curacoa, but they did little to<br>
follow up the successes already gained. Again the Eight sent a memorial<br>
to the company, boldly condemning the conduct of the director and<br>
demanding his recall. Their remonstrances were at last heeded, and the<br>
removal of the unpopular governor resolved upon. In 1647 Kieft set sail<br>
for Holland, but the ship was wrecked, and he with nearly all on board<br>
was drowned.<br>
<br>
It was high time for a change. In the two years, 1643-45, while sixteen<br>
hundred Indians had been slain, Manhattan had become nearly depopulated.<br>
In 1645 peace was concluded, not only with the smaller tribes in the<br>
vicinity, but also with the powerful Mohawks about Fort Orange, and<br>
finally with all the Indians belonging to the Five Nations or<br>
acknowledging their authority. A pleasing incident of this treaty was<br>
the promise of the Indians to restore the eight-year-old granddaughter<br>
of Mrs. Hutchinson, a promise which they faithfully performed in 1646.<br>
The great compact was made under the shadow of the Fort Amsterdam walls,<br>
and the universal joy was expressed by a day of thanksgiving.<br>

[1650-1660]<br>
<br>
An interval of peace for ten years was now enjoyed, when the killing of<br>
a squaw for stealing some peaches led to an attack by several hundred of<br>
the infuriated savages upon New Amsterdam. They were repulsed here, but<br>
crossing to the shore of New Jersey they laid waste the settlements<br>
there. Staten Island, too, was swept with fire and sword. One hundred<br>
people were slain, 150 more taken captive, 300 made homeless. Peace was<br>
again effected and maintained for three years, when fresh quarrels<br>
began. It was not until 1660 that a more general and lasting treaty was<br>
brought about, on which occasion a Mohawk and a Minqua chief gave<br>
pledges in behalf of the Indians, and acted as mediators between the<br>
contending parties.<br>

<br>
1660--1763<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I.<br>
<br>
NEW ENGLAND UNDER THE LAST STUARTS<br>
<br>
[1660]<br>
<br>
The Commonwealth in England went to pieces at the death of Oliver<br>
Cromwell, its founder. The Stuart dynasty came back, but, alas!<br>
unimproved. Charles II. was a much meaner man than his father, and James<br>
II. was more detestable still. The rule of such kings was destined to<br>
work sad changes in the hitherto free condition of Massachusetts. This<br>
colony had sympathized with the Commonwealth more heartily than any of<br>
the others. Hither had fled for refuge Goffe and Whalley, two of the<br>
accomplices in the death of Charles I. Congregational church polity was<br>
here established by law, to the exclusion of all others, even of<br>
episcopacy, for whose sake Charles was harrying poor Covenanters to<br>
death on every hillside in Scotland. Nor would his lawyers let the king<br>
forget Charles I.'s attack on the Massachusetts charter, begun so early<br>
as 1635, or the grounds therefor, such as the unwarranted transfer of it<br>
to Boston, or the likelihood that but for the outbreak of the Civil War<br>
it would have been annulled by the Long Parliament itself. Obviously<br>
Massachusetts could not hope to be let alone by the home government<br>
which had just come in.<br>
<br>
At first the king, graciously responding to the colony's humble<br>
petition, confirmed the charter granted by his father; but no sooner had<br>
he done so than the hot royalists about him began plotting to overthrow<br>
the same, and their purpose never slumbered till it was accomplished.<br>
Massachusetts was too prosperous and too visibly destined for great<br>
power in America to be suffered longer to go its independent way as<br>
hitherto.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/203Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>King Charles II.<br>
<br>
[1661]<br>
<br>
The province--as yet, of course, excluding Plymouth with its twelve<br>
towns and five thousand inhabitants--contained at this time, 1660, about<br>
twenty-five thousand souls, living in fifty-two towns. These were nearly<br>
all on the coast; Dedham, Concord, Brookfield, Lancaster, Marlborough,<br>
and the Connecticut Valley hamlets of Springfield, Hadley, and<br>
Northampton being the most noteworthy exceptions. Though agriculture was<br>
the principal business, fishing was a staple industry, its product going<br>
to France, Spain, and the Straits. Pipe-staves, fir-boards, much<br>
material for ships, as masts, pitch and tar, also pork and beef, horses<br>
and corn, were shipped from this colony to Virginia, in return for<br>
tobacco and sugar either for home consumption or for export to England.<br>
Some iron was manufactured. The province enjoyed great prosperity.<br>
Boston stood forth as a lively and growing centre, and an English<br>
traveller about this time declared some of its merchants to be "damnable<br>
rich."<br>
<br>
As their most precious possession the colonists prized their liberties,<br>
which they claimed in virtue of their original patent. In a paper which<br>
it put forth on June 10, 1661, the General Court asserted for the colony<br>
the right to elect and empower its own officers, both high and low, to<br>
make its laws, to execute the same without appeal so long as they were<br>
not repugnant to those of England, and to defend itself by force and<br>
arms when necessary, against every infringement of its rights, even from<br>
acts of Parliament or of the king, if prejudicial to the country or<br>
contrary to just colonial legislation. In a word Massachusetts, even so<br>
early, regarded itself to all intents and purposes an independent State,<br>
and would have proclaimed accordingly had it felt sufficiently strong.<br>
<br>
[1664]<br>
<br>
Manifestly the king would not grant so much. On the occasion of his<br>
confirming the charter he demanded that the oath of allegiance be taken<br>
by the people of the colony; that justice be administered there in his<br>
name; and that the franchise be extended to all freemen of sufficient<br>
substance, with the liberty to use in worship, public and private, the<br>
forms of the English Church. The people obeyed but in part, for they<br>
would not even appear to admit the king's will to be their law.&nbsp;
The<br>
franchise was slightly extended, in a grudging way, but no new religious<br>
privileges were at this time conceded. Unfortunately political and<br>
religious liberty were now in conflict. It was worse for the Baptists<br>
and Quakers that the king favored them, and the treatment which they<br>
received in the colony inclined them to the royalist side in the<br>
controversy.<br>
<br>
In July, 1664, commissioners arrived in Boston with full authority to<br>
investigate the administration of the New England charters. Such a<br>
procedure not being provided for in the Massachusetts document, the<br>
General Court, backed by the citizens almost to a man, successfully<br>
prevented complainants from appearing before the commission. The<br>
commissioners having summoned the colony as defendant in a certain case,<br>
a herald trumpeted proclamation through the streets, on the morning set<br>
for the trial, inhibiting all from aiding their designs. The trial<br>
collapsed, and the gentlemen who had ordered it, baffled and disgusted,<br>
moved on to New Hampshire, there also to be balked by a decree of the<br>
Massachusetts Governor and Council forbidding the towns so much as to<br>
meet at their behest.<br>
<br>
[1668]<br>
<br>
Vengeance for such defiance was delayed by Charles II.'s very vices.<br>
Clarendon's fall had left him surrounded by profligate aides, too timid<br>
and too indolent to face the resolute men of Massachusetts. They often<br>
discussed the contumacy of the colony, but went no further than words.<br>
Massachusetts was even encouraged, in 1668, forcibly to reassert its<br>
authority in Maine, against rule either by the king or by Sir Ferdinanda<br>
Gorges's heir as proprietary.<br>
<br>
Its charter had assigned to the colony land to a point three miles north<br>
of the Merrimac. Bold in the favor of the Commonwealth, the authorities<br>
measured from the head-waters of that river. But Plymouth had originally<br>
claimed all the territory west of the Kennebec, and had sold it to<br>
Gorges. Charles II. favored the Gorges heirs against Massachusetts, and<br>
for some years previous to 1668 Massachusetts' power over Maine had been<br>
in abeyance. Ten years later, in 1678, to make assurance doubly sure,<br>
Massachusetts bought off the Gorges claimants, at the round price of<br>
twelve hundred and fifty pounds sterling.<br>
<br>
[1673]<br>
<br>
From 1641 Massachusetts had borne sway in New Hampshire as well,<br>
ignoring John Mason's claim under Charles I.'s charters of 1629 and<br>
1635, still urged by one of Mason's grandsons, backed by Charles II.<br>
Here Massachusetts was beaten. In July, 1679, New Hampshire was<br>
permanently separated from her, and erected into a royal province, of a<br>
nature to be explained in a subsequent chapter, being the earliest<br>
government of this kind in New England.<br>
<br>
[1662]<br>
<br>
These territorial assumptions on the part of Massachusetts much<br>
increased the king's hostility. This probably would not have proved<br>
fatal had it not been re-enforced by the determination of the merchants<br>
and manufacturers of the mother-country to crush what they feared was<br>
becoming a rival power beyond seas. They insisted upon full enforcement<br>
of the Navigation Laws, which made America's foreign trade in a cruel<br>
degree subservient to English interest. So incorrigible was the colony,<br>
it was found that this end could be compassed only by the abrogation of<br>
the charter, so that English law might become immediately valid in<br>
Massachusetts, colonial laws to the contrary notwithstanding.<br>
Accordingly, in 1684, the charter was vacated and the colonists ceased<br>
to be free, their old government with its popular representation giving<br>
way to an arbitrary commission.<br>
<br>
The other New England colonies--Plymouth, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and<br>
New Haven--had made haste to proclaim Charles II. so soon as restored to<br>
the throne, and to begin carrying on their governments in his name. That<br>
beautiful and able man, the younger Winthrop, sped to London on<br>
Connecticut's behalf, and, aided by his colony's friends at court, the<br>
Earls of Clarendon and Manchester and Viscount Say and Seal, in 1662<br>
secured to Connecticut, now made to include New Haven, a charter so<br>
liberal that it continued till October 5, 1818, the ground law of the<br>
State, then to be supplanted only by a close vote. Under this paper,<br>
which declared all lands between the Narragansett River and the Pacific<br>
Ocean Connecticut territory, Connecticut received every whit of that<br>
right to govern itself which Charles was so sternly challenging in the<br>
case of Massachusetts.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/210Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>John Winthrop the Younger.<br>
<br>
From this time on, as indeed earlier, Connecticut was for many years<br>
perhaps the most delightful example of popular government in all<br>
history. Connecticut and New Haven together had about ten thousand<br>
inhabitants. Their rulers were just, wise, and of a mind truly to serve<br>
the people. Here none were persecuted for their faith. Education was<br>
universal. Few were poor, none very rich. Nearly all supplies were of<br>
domestic production, nothing as yet being exported but a few cattle.<br>
<br>
Under the second Charles Rhode Island fared quite as well as<br>
Connecticut. This was remarkable, inasmuch as the little colony of three<br>
thousand souls, in their four towns of Providence, Newport, Portsmouth,<br>
and Warwick, insisted on "holding forth the lively experiment"--and it<br>
proved lively indeed--"of full liberty in religious concernments."<br>
Charles did not oppose this, and Clarendon favored it, a motive of both<br>
here, as with Connecticut, being to rear in New England a power friendly<br>
to the Crown, that should rival and check Massachusetts. Both these<br>
commonwealths were granted absolute independence in all but name. No<br>
oath of allegiance to the king was demanded. Appeals to England were not<br>
provided for.<br>
<br>
[1680]<br>
<br>
Though having no quarrel with the king, the two southern colonies were<br>
not without their trials. Connecticut, besides continual fear of the<br>
Dutch and the Indians, was much agitated by the controversy over the<br>
question whether children of moral parents not church members should be<br>
baptized, a question at length settled affirmatively by the so-called<br>
Half-Way Covenant. It also had its boundary disputes with Massachusetts,<br>
with Rhode Island--for Connecticut took the Narragansett River of its<br>
charter to be the bay of that name--and with New York, which, by the<br>
Duke of York's new patent, issued on the recovery of that province from<br>
the Dutch in 1674, reached the Connecticut River. During England's war<br>
with Holland, 1672-74, all the colonies stood in some fear of Dutch<br>
attacks.<br>
<br>
[1685]<br>
<br>
Rhode Island had worse troubles than Connecticut. It, too, had boundary<br>
disputes, serious and perpetual; but graver by much were its internal<br>
feuds, caused partly by the mutual jealousy of its four towns, partly by<br>
the numerous and jarring religious persuasions here represented.<br>
Government was painfully feeble. Only with utmost difficulty could the<br>
necessary taxes be raised. Warwick in particular was for some time in<br>
arrears to John Clark, of Newport, for his invaluable services in<br>
securing the charter of 1663. Quakers and the divers sorts of Baptists<br>
valiantly warred each against other, using, with dreadful address, those<br>
most deadly of carnal weapons, tongue and pen. On George Fox's visit to<br>
the colony, Roger Williams, zealous for a debate, pursued the eminent<br>
Quaker from Providence to Newport, rowing thither in his canoe and<br>
arriving at midnight, only to find that his intended opponent had<br>
departed, The latter's champion was ready, however, and a discussion of<br>
four days ensued.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/214Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Sir Edmond Andros.<br>
<br>
Before its sentence of death reached Massachusetts Charles II. was no<br>
more, and James II., his brother, had ascended the throne. It was for a<br>
time uncertain what sort of authority the stricken colony would be<br>
called to accept. Already, as Duke of York, James II. had been<br>
Proprietary of Maine east of the Kennebec (Sagadahoc), as well as of<br>
Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Now that he had the problem of<br>
ruling Massachusetts to solve, it naturally occurred to the king to make<br>
Sir Edmond Andros, already governor of New York, master also over the<br>
whole of English America from the Saint Croix to the Delaware.<br>
<br>
In southern New England the reign of Andros wrought no downright<br>
persecution. He suspended the charters, and, with an irresponsible<br>
council in each colony, assumed all legislative as well as<br>
administrative power. Rhode Island submitted tamely. Her sister colony<br>
did the same, save that, at Hartford, according to good tradition, in<br>
the midst of the altercation about delivering the charter, prolonged<br>
into candle-light, suddenly it was dark, and the precious document<br>
disappeared to a secure place in the hollow trunk of an oak. This tree,<br>
henceforth called the Charter Oak, stood till prostrated by a gale on<br>
August 20, 1856.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/216Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>The Charter Oak at Hartford.<br>
<br>
But in Massachusetts the colonists' worst fears were realized. Andros,<br>
with a council of his own creation, made laws, levied taxes, and<br>
controlled the militia. He had authority to suppress all<br>
printing-presses and to encourage Episcopacy. In the latter interest he<br>
opened King's Chapel to the Prayer Book. His permission was required for<br>
any one to leave the colony. Extortionate fees and taxes were imposed.<br>
Puritans had to swear on the Bible, which they regarded wicked, or be<br>
disfranchised. Personal and proprietary rights were summarily set at<br>
naught, and all deeds to land were declared void till renewed--for<br>
money, of course. The citizens were reduced to a condition hardly short<br>
of slavery.<br>
<br>
[1688]<br>
<br>
There is no describing the joy which pervaded New England as the news of<br>
the Revolution of 1688 flew from colony to colony. Andros slunk away<br>
from Boston, glad to escape alive. Drums beat and gala-day was kept. Old<br>
magistrates were reinstated. Town meetings were resumed. All believed<br>
that God had interposed, in answer to prayer, to bring deliverance to<br>
his people from popery and thraldom.<br>
<br>
This revolution, ushering in the liberal monarchy of William and Mary,<br>
restored to Rhode Island and Connecticut their old charter governments<br>
in full. New Hampshire, after a momentary union with Massachusetts<br>
again, became once more a royal province. As to Massachusetts itself, a<br>
large party of the citizens now either did not wish the old state of<br>
things renewed, or were too timid to agree in demanding back their<br>
charter as of right. Had they been bold and united, they might have<br>
succeeded in this without any opposition from the Crown. Instead, a new<br>
charter was conferred, creating Massachusetts also a royal province, yet<br>
with government more liberal than the other provinces of this order<br>
enjoyed. The governor was appointed by the Crown, and could convene,<br>
adjourn, or dissolve the Legislature. With the consent of his council he<br>
also created the judges, from whose highest sentence appeal could be<br>
taken to the Privy Council. The governor could veto legislation, and the<br>
king annul any law under three years old.<br>
<br>
[1690-1697]<br>
<br>
If in these things the new polity was inferior to the old, in two<br>
respects it was superior; Suffrage was now practically universal, and<br>
every species of religious profession, save Catholicism, made legal.<br>
Also, Massachusetts territory was enlarged southward to take in all<br>
Plymouth, eastward to embrace Maine (Sagadahoc) and Nova Scotia. Maine,<br>
henceforth including Sagadahoc, that is, all land eastward to the Saint<br>
Croix, remained part of Massachusetts till March 15, 1820, when it<br>
became a member of the Union by itself. Nova Scotia, over which Phips's<br>
conquest of Port Royal in 1690 had established a nominal rather than a<br>
real English authority, was assigned to France again by the Treaty of<br>
Ryswick, 1697.<br>

CHAPTER II.<br>
<br>
KING PHILIP'S WAR<br>
<br>
[1675]<br>
<br>
Simultaneously with the Stuart Restoration another cloud darkened the<br>
New England sky. Since the Pequot War, Indians and whites had in the<br>
main been friendly. This by itself is proof that our fathers were less<br>
unjust to the red men than is sometimes charged. They did assume the<br>
right to acquire lands here, and they had this right. The Indians were<br>
not in any proper sense owners of New England. They were few--by 1660<br>
not more numerous than the pale-faces--and, far from settling or<br>
occupying the land, roamed from place to place. Had it been otherwise<br>
they, as barbarians, would have had no such claim upon the territory as<br>
to justify them in barring out civilization. However, the colonists did<br>
not plead this consideration. Whenever districts were desired to which<br>
Indians had any obvious title, it was both law and custom to pay them<br>
their price. In this, Roger Williams and William Penn were not peculiar.<br>
If individual white men sometimes cheated in land trades, as in other<br>
negotiations, the aggrieved side could not, and did not, regard this as<br>
the white man's policy.<br>
<br>
Yet little by little the Indians came to distrust and hate the rival<br>
race. It did not matter to the son of the forest, even if he thought so<br>
far, that the neighborhood of civilization greatly bettered his lot in<br>
many things, as, for instance, giving him market for corn and peltry,<br>
which he could exchange for fire-arms, blankets, and all sorts of<br>
valuable conveniences. The efforts to teach and elevate him he<br>
appreciated still less. As has been said, he loved better to disfurnish<br>
the outside of other people's heads than to furnish the inside of his<br>
own. What he felt, and keenly, was that the newcomers treated him as an<br>
inferior, were day by day narrowing his range, and slowly but surely<br>
reducing his condition to that of a subject people. Dull as he was, he<br>
saw that one of three fates confronted him: to perish, to migrate, or to<br>
lay aside his savage character and mode of life. Such thoughts frenzied<br>
him.<br>
<br>
The beautiful fidelity of Massasoit to the people of Plymouth is already<br>
familiar. His son Alexander, who succeeded him, was of a spirit<br>
diametrically the reverse. Convinced that he was plotting with the<br>
Narragansets for hostile action, the Governor and Council of Plymouth<br>
sent Major Winslow to bring him to court--for it must be remembered that<br>
Massasoit's tribe, the Pokanokets, had through him covenanted, though<br>
probably with no clear idea of what this meant, to be subject to the<br>
Plymouth government. Alexander, for some reason, became fatally ill<br>
while at Plymouth under arrest, dying before reaching home. The Indians<br>
suspected poison.<br>
<br>
His brother Philip now became sachem. Philip already had a grudge<br>
against the whites, and was rendered trebly bitter by the indignity and<br>
violence, if nothing worse, to which Alexander had been subjected. He<br>
resolved upon war, and in 1675 war was begun.<br>
<br>
We shall never certainly know to what extent Philip was an organizer. We<br>
believe correct the view of Hubbard, the contemporary historian, that he<br>
had prepared a wide-spread and pretty well arranged conspiracy among<br>
the main tribes of New England Indians, which might have been fatal but<br>
for "the special providence of God," causing hostilities to break out<br>
ere the savages were ready. Palfrey challenges this view of the case,<br>
but on insufficient grounds.<br>
<br>
One Sausaman, an educated Indian, previously Philip's secretary, had<br>
left him and joined the Christian Indians settled at Natick. There were<br>
by this time several such communities, and also, according to Cotton<br>
Mather, many able Indian preachers. At the risk of his life, as he<br>
insisted, Sausaman had warned the Plymouth magistrates that danger<br>
impended. He was soon murdered, apparently by Philip's instigation. At<br>
least Philip never denied this, nor did he after this time ever again<br>
court friendly relations with Plymouth, which he had constantly done<br>
hitherto. On the contrary, re-enforcements of strange Indians, all ready<br>
for the war-path, were continually flocking to his camp, squaws and<br>
children at the same time going to the Narraganset country, manifestly<br>
for security.<br>
<br>
The Plymouth authorities, preparing for war, yet sent a kind letter to<br>
the sachem advising him to peace. In vain. At Swanzey, the town nearest<br>
Mount Hope, Philip's home, Indians at once began to kill and ravage, and<br>
Majors Bradford and Cudworth marched thither with a force of Plymouth<br>
soldiers. A Massachusetts contingent re-enforced them there, and they<br>
prepared to advance. Seeing it impossible to hold his own against so<br>
many, Philip crossed to Pocasset, now Tiverton, and swept rapidly round<br>
to Dartmouth, Middleborough, and Taunton, burning and murdering as he<br>
went. He then retired again to Tiverton, but in a few days started with<br>
all his warriors for central Massachusetts.<br>
<br>
Here the Nipmucks, already at war, which indicated an understanding<br>
between them and the Pokanokets, had attacked Mendon. The day after<br>
Philip joined them there was a fight at Brookfield, the Nipmucks and<br>
their allies being victorious. They proceeded to burn the town nearly<br>
entire, though the inhabitants who survived, after a three days' siege<br>
in a fortified house, were relieved by troops from Boston just in the<br>
nick of time.<br>
<br>
The Connecticut Valley was next the theatre of war. Springfield,<br>
Hatfield, Deerfield, and Northfield were attacked the last two having to<br>
be abandoned. At Hadley the onset occurred on a fast-day. The men rushed<br>
from their worship with their muskets, which were ready to hand in<br>
church, and hastily formed for battle. Bewildered by the unexpected<br>
assault, they were on the point of yielding, when, according to<br>
tradition, an aged hero with long beard and queer clothing appeared,<br>
placed himself at their head and directed their movements. His evident<br>
acquaintance with fighting restored order and courage. The savages were<br>
driven pell-mell out of town, but the pursuers looked in vain for their<br>
deliverer. If the account is correct, it was the regicide, General<br>
Goffe, who had been a secret guest in the house of the Rev. Mr. Russell.<br>
He could not in such danger refrain from engaging once again, as he had<br>
so often done during the Civil War in England, in the defence of God's<br>
people.<br>
<br>
From Hadley a party went to Deerfield to bring in the wheat that had<br>
been left when the town was deserted. Ninety picked men, the "flower of<br>
Essex," led by Captain Lothrop, attended the wagons as convoy. On their<br>
return, about seven o'clock in the morning, by a little stream in the<br>
present village of South Deerfield, since called Bloody Brook in memory<br>
of the event, the soldiers dispersed somewhat in quest of grapes, then<br>
ripe, when a sudden and fatal volley from an ambush was delivered upon<br>
them. The men had left their muskets in the wagons and could not regain<br>
them. Lothrop was shot dead, and but seven or eight of his company<br>
escaped alive. A monument marks the spot where this tragic affair<br>
occurred.<br>
<br>

<big><big>The Monument at Bloody Brook.<br>
<br>
So early as July, 1675, Massachusetts and Connecticut, acting for the<br>
New England Confederation, had effected a treaty with the strong tribe<br>
of the Narragansets in southern Rhode Island, engaging them to remain<br>
neutral and to surrender any of Philip's men coming within their<br>
jurisdiction. This agreement they did not keep. After the attacks on<br>
Springfield and Hatfield in October, great numbers of the Pokanoket<br>
braves came to them, evidently welcomed. To prevent their becoming a<br>
centre of mischief, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Plymouth despatched<br>
a thousand men to punish the Narragansets. They met the foe at the old<br>
Palisade, in the midst of a dense swamp in what is now South Kingstown,<br>
Rhode Island. The terrible cold which rendered this Narraganset campaign<br>
so severe had turned the marsh into a bridge, and at once on their<br>
arrival the soldiers, weary and hungry as they were from their long<br>
march, and spite of its being Sunday, advanced to the attack.<br>
Massachusetts was in front, then Plymouth, then Connecticut. Long and<br>
bitter was the fight. The Indians, perfect marksmen, took deadly aim at<br>
the leaders. Five captains were killed outright and as many more<br>
mortally wounded. The fort was taken, re-taken, and taken again, the<br>
whites at last, to make sure work, setting fire to the wigwams. The<br>
storming party lost in killed and wounded one-fifth of its number. This<br>
Swamp Fight, as it was called, broke forever the strength of the<br>
Narragansets, the tribe and its allies dispersing in all directions.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/229Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Goffe at Hadley.<br>
<br>
[1676]<br>
<br>
In 1676 central Massachusetts was again aflame. Lancaster was sacked and<br>
burned, its inhabitants nearly all either carried captive or put to<br>
death with indescribable atrocities. Mrs. Rowlandson, wife of the<br>
Lancaster Minister, also her son and two daughters, were among the<br>
captives. We have this brave woman's story as subsequently detailed by<br>
herself. Her youngest, a little girl of six, wounded by a bullet, she<br>
bore in her arms wherever they marched, till the poor creature died of<br>
cold, starvation, and lack of care. The agonized mother begged the<br>
privilege of tugging along the corpse, but was refused. She with her son<br>
and living daughter were ransomed, after wandering up and down with the<br>
savages eleven weeks and five days.<br>
<br>
From Mrs. Rowlandson's narrative we have many interesting facts touching<br>
the Indians' habits of life. They carried ample stores from Lancaster,<br>
but soon squandered them, and were reduced to a diet of garbage, horses'<br>
entrails, ears, and liver, with broth made of horses' feet and legs. The<br>
liver they seemed to prefer raw. Their chief food was ground-nuts. They<br>
also ate acorns, artichokes, beans, and various sorts of roots. They<br>
especially delighted in old bones, which, being heated to drive out<br>
maggots and worms, they first boiled for soup, then ground for use as<br>
meal.<br>
<br>
The captive lady often saw Philip. At his request she made a shirt and a<br>
cap for his son, for which he paid her. Says Hubbard, "Such was the<br>
goodness of God to these poor captive women and children that they found<br>
so much favor in the sight of their enemies that they offered no wrong<br>
to any of their persons save what they could not help, being in many<br>
wants themselves. Neither did they offer any uncivil carriage to any of<br>
the females, nor ever attempt the chastity of any of them." So soon as<br>
negotiations were opened for Mrs. Rowlandson's release, Philip told her<br>
of this, and expressed the hope that they would succeed. When her ransom<br>
had arrived he met her with a smile, saying: "I have pleasant words for<br>
you this morning; would you like to hear them? You are to go home<br>
to-morrow," Twenty pounds were paid for her, raised by some ladies of<br>
Boston, aided by a Mr. Usher.<br>
<br>
Hostilities now bore southeastward. Philip was in his glory. All the<br>
towns of Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts were in terror, nearly<br>
all in actual danger. At Medfield twenty whites were killed. Deserted<br>
Mendon was burned. Weymouth was attacked, and eleven persons were<br>
massacred in the edge of Plymouth. In Groton and Marlborough every house<br>
was laid in ashes, as were all in lower Rhode Island up to Warwick, and<br>
in Warwick all but one. Sachem Canonchet of the Narragansets drew into<br>
ambush at Pawtuxet a band of Plymouth soldiers, of whom only one<br>
escaped. Canonchet was subsequently taken by Captain Denison and<br>
executed. Rehoboth lost forty houses, Providence nearly as many.<br>
<br>
The Connecticut Valley was invaded afresh. Springfield, Hadley,<br>
Northampton, and Hatfield were once more startled by the war-whoop and<br>
the whiz of the tomahawk. Captain Turner, hearing of an Indian camp at<br>
the falls of the Connecticut, now called by his name, in Montague,<br>
advanced with a troop of one hundred and eighty horse, arriving in sight<br>
of the encampment at daylight. Dismounting and proceeding stealthily to<br>
within sure shot, they beat up the Indians' quarters with a ringing<br>
volley of musketry. Resistance was impossible. Those who did not fall by<br>
bullet or sword rushed to the river, many being carried over the falls.<br>
Three hundred savages perished, the English losing but one man.&nbsp; A
large<br>
stock of the enemy's food and ammunition was also destroyed. Though so<br>
splendidly successful, the party did not return to Hadley without<br>
considerable loss, being set upon much of the way by Indians who had<br>
heard the firing at the falls and sped to the relief of their friends.<br>
Turner was killed in the meadows by Green River; his subordinate,<br>
Holyoke, then commanding the retreat.<br>
<br>
[1678]<br>
<br>
Turner's victory brought the war to a crisis. The red men lacked<br>
resources. The whites had learned the secrets of savage warfare. They<br>
could no longer be led into ambush, while their foe at no time during<br>
the war ventured to engage them in open field. Large parties of Indians<br>
began to surrender; many roving bands were captured. Hostilities<br>
continued still many months in Maine, the whites more and more uniformly<br>
successful, till the Treaty of Casco, April 12, 1678, at last terminated<br>
the war.<br>
<br>
Hunted by the English backward and forward, Philip was at last driven to<br>
his old home upon Mount Hope.&nbsp; Here Captain Church, one of the most<br>
practised of Indian fighters, surprised him on the morning of August 12,<br>
1676, encamped upon a little upland, which it is believed has been<br>
exactly identified near a swamp at the foot of the mountain. By<br>
residents in the neighborhood it is known as Little Guinea. At the first<br>
firing Philip, but partially dressed, seized gun and powder-horn and<br>
made for the swamp, Captain Church's ambush was directly in his front.<br>
An Englishman's piece missed fire, but an Indian sent a bullet through<br>
the Great Sachem's heart.<br>
<br>
In this fearful war at least six hundred of the English inhabitants<br>
either fell in battle or were murdered by the enemy, A dozen or more<br>
towns were utterly destroyed, others greatly damaged, Some six hundred<br>
buildings, chiefly dwelling-houses, were consumed by fire, and over a<br>
hundred thousand pounds of colonial money expended, to say nothing of<br>
the immense losses in goods and cattle.<br>
<br>
Not without propriety has the Pokanoket chief been denominated a king.<br>
If not a Charlemagne or a Louis XIV., he yet possessed elements of true<br>
greatness. While he lived his mind evidently guided, as his will<br>
dominated and prolonged, the war. This is saying much, for the Indian's<br>
disinclination to all strenuous or continuous exertion was pronounced<br>
and proverbial. Philip's treatment of Mrs. Rowlandson must be declared<br>
magnanimous, especially as, of course, he was but a savage king, who<br>
might reasonably request us not to measure him by our rules. The other<br>
party to the war we have a right to judge more rigidly, and just<br>
sentence in their case must be severe. Philip's sorrowing, innocent wife<br>
and son were brought prisoners to Plymouth, and their lot referred to<br>
the ministers. After long deliberation and prayer it was decided that<br>
they should be sold into slavery, and this was their fate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
THE SALEM WITCHCRAFT<br>
<br>
[1675]<br>
<br>
The home life of colonial New England was unique. Its like has appeared<br>
nowhere else in human history. Mostwise it was beautiful as well. In it<br>
religion was central and supreme. The General Court of Plymouth very<br>
early passed the following order: "Noe dwelling-howse shal be builte<br>
above halfe a myle from the meeting-howse in any newe plantacion without<br>
leave from the Court, except mylle-howses and ffermehowses." In laying<br>
out a village the meeting-house, as the hub to which everything was to<br>
be referred, was located first of all. The minister's lot commonly<br>
adjoined. Then a sufficiency of land was parcelled off to each<br>
freeholder whereon to erect his dwelling. Massachusetts from the first,<br>
and Plymouth beginning somewhat later, also made eminent provision for<br>
schools--all in the interest of religion.<br>
<br>
The earliest residences were necessarily of logs, shaped and fitted more<br>
or less rudely according to the skill of the builder or the time and<br>
means at his disposal. There was usually one large room below, which<br>
served as kitchen, dining-room, sitting-room, and parlor, and on the<br>
same floor with this one or two lodging-rooms. An unfinished attic<br>
constituted the dormitory for the rising generation. A huge stone<br>
chimney, terminating below in a still more capacious fireplace, that<br>
would admit logs from four to eight feet in length, conveyed away the<br>
smoke, and with it much of the heat. This involved no loss, as wood was<br>
a drug. Communicating with the chimney was the great stone baking-oven,<br>
whence came the bouncing loaves of corn-bread, duly "brown," the<br>
rich-colored "pompion" pies, and the loin of venison, beef, or pork.<br>
<br>
Over these bounties--and such they were heartily esteemed, however<br>
meagre--often as the family drew around the table, its head offered<br>
thanks to the heavenly Giver. Each morning, after they had eaten, he<br>
read a goodly portion of God's Word, never less than a chapter, and<br>
then, not kneeling but standing, led his household in reverent and<br>
believing prayer for protection, guidance, stimulus in good, and for<br>
every needed grace. What purity, what love of rectitude, what strength<br>
of will did not the builders of America carry forth from that family<br>
altar! He who would understand the richest side and the deepest moving<br>
forces of our national life and development must not overlook those New<br>
England fireside scenes.<br>
<br>
[1688-1700]<br>
<br>
Prayers ended, the "men folks" went forth to the day's toil. It was<br>
hard, partly from its then rough character, partly from poverty of<br>
appliances. For the hardest jobs neighbors would join hands, fighting<br>
nature as they had to fight the Indians, unitedly. Farming tools, if of<br>
iron or steel, as axe, mattock, spade, and the iron nose for the digger<br>
or the plough, the village blacksmith usually fashioned, as he did the<br>
bake-pan, griddle, crane, and pothooks, for indoor use. Tables, chairs,<br>
cradles, bedsteads, and those straight-backed "settles" of which a few<br>
may yet be seen, were either home-made or gotten up by the village<br>
carpenter. Mattresses were at first of hay, straw, leaves, or rushes.<br>
Before 1700, however, feather beds were common, and houses and the<br>
entire state of a New England farmer's home had become somewhat more<br>
lordly than the above picture might indicate. The colonists made much<br>
use of berries, wild fruits, bread and milk, game, fish, and shellfish.<br>
The stock wandered in the forests and about the brooks, to be brought<br>
home at night by the boys, whom the sound of the cow-bell led. In autumn<br>
bushels upon bushels of nuts were laid by, to serve, along with dried<br>
berries and grapes, salted fish and venison, as food for the winter.<br>
Every phase and circumstance of this pioneer life reminded our fathers<br>
of their dependence upon nature and the Supreme Power behind nature,<br>
while at the same time the continual need and application of neighbor's<br>
co-operation with neighbor brought out brotherly love in charming<br>
strength and beauty.<br>
<br>
But to old New England religion, as a clerical, public, and organized<br>
affair, there is a far darker side. In the eighteenth century belief in<br>
witchcraft was nearly universal. In 1683 one Margaret Matron was tried<br>
in Pennsylvania on a charge of bewitching cows and geese, and placed<br>
under bonds of one hundred pounds for good behavior. In 1705 Grace<br>
Sherwood was ducked in Virginia for the same offence. Cases of the kind<br>
had occurred in New York. There was no colony where the belief in<br>
astrology, necromancy, second sight, ghosts, haunted houses and spots,<br>
love-spells, charms, and peculiar powers attaching to rings, herbs,<br>
etc., did not prevail. Such credulity was not peculiar to America, but<br>
cursed Europe as well. It seemed to flourish, if anything, after the<br>
Reformation more than before. Luther firmly believed in witchcraft. He<br>
professed to have met the Evil One in personal conflict, and to have<br>
vanquished him by the use of an inkstand as missile. Perhaps every land<br>
in Europe had laws making witchcraft a capital crime. One was enacted in<br>
England under Henry VIII., another in James I.'s first year, denouncing<br>
death against all persons "invoking any evil spirit, or consulting,<br>
covenanting with, entertaining, employing, feeding, or rewarding any<br>
evil spirit, or taking up dead bodies from their graves to be used in<br>
any witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment, or killing or otherwise<br>
hurting any person by such infernal arts." A similar statute was<br>
contained in the "Fundamentals" of Massachusetts, probably inspired by<br>
the command of Scripture, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." This<br>
law, we shall see, was not a dead letter.<br>
<br>
No wonder such a law was of more effect in New England than anywhere<br>
else on earth. The official religion of the Puritans was not only<br>
superstitious in general but gloomy in particular, and most gloomy in<br>
New England. Its central tenet, here at least, seemed to be that life<br>
ought to furnish no joy, men seeking to "merit heaven by making earth a<br>
hell." Sunday laws were severe, and rigidly enforced from six o'clock<br>
Saturday evening till the same hour the next. Not the least work was<br>
allowed unless absolutely necessary, nor any semblance of amusement.<br>
Boys bringing home the cows were cautioned to "let down the bars softly,<br>
as it was the Lord's day." Sunday travellers were arrested and fined.<br>
Men might be whipped for absence from church. A girl at Plymouth was<br>
threatened exile as a street-walker for smiling in meeting. Increase<br>
Mather traced the great Boston fire of 1711 to the sin of Sunday labor,<br>
such as carrying parcels and baking food. In Newport, some men having<br>
been drowned who, to say good-by to departing friends, had rowed out to<br>
a ship just weighing anchor, Rev. John Comer prayed that others might<br>
take warning and "do no more such great wickedness."<br>
<br>
Sermons were often two hours long; public prayer half an hour. Worse<br>
still was what went by the name of music--doggerel hymns full of the<br>
most sulphurous theology, uttered congregationally as "lined off" by the<br>
leader--nasal, dissonant, and discordant in the highest imaginable<br>
degree. The church itself was but a barn, homely-shaped, bare, and in<br>
winter cold as out-of-doors. At this season men wrapped their feet in<br>
bags, and women stuffed their muffs with hot stones. Sleepers were<br>
rudely awakened by the tithing-man's baton thwacking their heads; or, if<br>
females, by its fox-tail end brushing their cheeks. Fast-days were<br>
common. Prayer opened every public meeting, secular as well as<br>
religious. The doctrine of special providences was pressed to a<br>
ridiculous extreme. The devil was believed in no less firmly than God,<br>
and indefinitely great power ascribed to him. The Catechism--book second<br>
in authority only to the Bible--contained of his Satanic Majesty a cut,<br>
which children were left, not to say taught, to suppose as correct a<br>
likeness as that of Cromwell, which crowned the mantels of so many<br>
homes.<br>

<br>
In a people thus trained the miracle is not that witchcraft and<br>
superstition did so much mischief, but so little. Had it not been for<br>
their sturdy Saxon good sense its results must have proved infinitely<br>
more sad. The first remarkable case of sorcery in New England occurred<br>
at Boston, in 1688. Four children of a pious family were affected in a<br>
peculiar manner, imitating the cries of cats and dogs, and complaining<br>
of pains all over their bodies. These were the regulation symptoms of<br>
witch-possession, which presumably they had often heard discussed. An<br>
old Irish serving-woman, indentured to the family, who already bore the<br>
name of a witch, was charged with having bewitched them, and executed,<br>
the four ministers of Boston having first held at the house a day of<br>
prayer and fasting.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/246Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Cotton Mather.<br>
<br>
Young Cotton Mather, grandson of the distinguished Rev. John Cotton, a<br>
man of vast erudition and fervent piety, was at this time colleague to<br>
his father, Increase Mather, as pastor of the Boston North Church. His<br>
imagination had been abnormally developed by fasts and vigils, in which<br>
he believed himself to hold uncommonly close communication with the<br>
Almighty. His desire to provide new arms for faith against the growing<br>
unbelief of his time led him to take one of the "bewitched" children to<br>
his house, that he might note and describe the ways of the devil in her<br>
case. The results he soon after published in his "Memorable Providences<br>
Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions." This work admitted no doubt as<br>
to the reality of the demoniac possessions, which indeed it affected to<br>
demonstrate forever. All the Boston ministers signed its preface,<br>
certifying to its "clear information" that "both a God and a devil, and<br>
witchcraft" existed. "Nothing too vile," it alleged, "can be said of,<br>
nothing too hard can be done to, such a horrible iniquity as witchcraft<br>
is." The publication excited great attention, and to it in no small<br>
measure the ensuing tragedy may be traced.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/248e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Old Tituba the Indian.<br>
<br>
In February, 1692, three more subjects, children of Rev. Mr. Parris,<br>
minister at Danvers, then called Salem Village, exhibited bad witchcraft<br>
symptoms. The utmost excitement prevailed. Neighboring clergymen joined<br>
the village in fasting and prayer. A general fast for the colony was<br>
ordered. But the "devilism," as Cotton Mather named it, spread instead<br>
of abating, the children having any number of imitators so soon as they<br>
became objects of general notice and sympathy. Old Tituba, an Indian<br>
crone, who had served in Parris's family, was the first to be denounced<br>
as the cause. Two other aged females, one crazy, the other bed-ridden,<br>
were also presently accused, and after a little while several ladies of<br>
Parris's church. Whoso uttered a whisper of incredulity, general or as<br>
to the blameworthiness of any whom Parris called guilty, was instantly<br>
indicted with them.<br>
<br>
On April 11th, the Deputy Governor held in the meeting-house in Salem<br>
Village a court for a preliminary examination of the prisoners. A scene<br>
at once ridiculous and tragic followed. When they were brought in, their<br>
alleged victims appeared overcome at their gaze, pretending to be<br>
bitten, pinched, scratched, choked, burned, or pricked by their<br>
invisible agency in revenge for refusing to subscribe to a covenant with<br>
the devil. Some were apparently stricken down by the glance of an eye<br>
from one of the culprits, others fainted, many writhed as in a fit.<br>
Tituba was beaten to make her confess. Others were tortured. Finally all<br>
the accused were thrown into irons. Numbers of accused persons, assured<br>
that it was their only chance for life, owned up to deeds of which they<br>
must have been entirely innocent. They had met the devil in the form of<br>
a small black man, had attended witch sacraments, where they renounced<br>
their Christian vows, and had ridden through the air on broomsticks.<br>
Such were the confessions of poor women who had never in their lives<br>
done any evil except possibly to tattle.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/250Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Lieutenant-Governor Stoughton.<br>
<br>
On June 2d, a special court was held in Salem for the definite trial.<br>
Stoughton, Lieutenant Governor, a man of small mind and bigoted temper,<br>
was president. The business began by the condemnation and hanging of a<br>
helpless woman. A jury of women had found on her person a wart, which<br>
was pronounced to be unquestionably a "devil's teat," and her neighbors<br>
remembered that many hens had died, animals become lame, and carts upset<br>
by her dreadful "devilism." By September 23d, twenty persons had gone to<br>
the gallows, eight more were under sentence, and fifty-five had<br>
"confessed" and turned informers as their only hope. The "afflicted" had<br>
increased to fifty. Jails were crammed with persons under accusation,<br>
and fresh charges of alliance with devils were brought forward every<br>
day.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/252Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Fac-simile of Sheriff's Return of an Execution.<br>
<br>
Some of the wretched victims displayed great fortitude. Goodman Procter<br>
lost his life by nobly and persistently--vainly as well,<br>
alas!--maintaining the innocence of his accused wife. George Burroughs,<br>
who had formerly preached in Salem Village, was indicted. His physical<br>
strength, which happened to be phenomenal, was adduced as lent him from<br>
the devil. Stoughton browbeat him through his whole trial. What sealed<br>
his condemnation, however, was his offer to the jury of a paper quoting<br>
an author who denied the possibility of witchcraft. His fervent prayers<br>
when on the scaffold, and especially his correct rendering of the Lord's<br>
Prayer, shook the minds of many. They argued that no witch could have<br>
gotten through those holy words correctly--a test upon which several had<br>
been condemned. Cotton Mather, present at the gallows, restored the<br>
crowd to faith by reminding them that the devil had the power to dress<br>
up like an angel of light. Rebecca Nurse, a woman of unimpeachable<br>
character hitherto, unable from partial deafness to understand, so as to<br>
explain, the allegations made against her, was convicted notwithstanding<br>
every proof in her favor.<br>
<br>
Reaction now began. Public opinion commenced to waver. No one knew whose<br>
turn to be hanged would come next. Emboldened by their fatal success,<br>
accusers whispered of people in high places as leagued with the Evil<br>
One. An Andover minister narrowly escaped death. The Beverly minister,<br>
Hale, one of the most active in denouncing witches, was aghast when his<br>
own wife was accused. Two sons of Governor Bradstreet were obliged to<br>
flee for their lives, one for refusing, as a magistrate, to issue any<br>
more warrants, the other charged with bewitching a dog. Several hurried<br>
to New York to escape conviction. The property of such was seized by<br>
their towns. A reign of terror prevailed.<br>
<br>
People slowly awoke to the terrible travesty of justice which was going<br>
on. Magistrates were seen to have overlooked the most flagrant instances<br>
of falsehood and contradiction on the part of both accusers and accused,<br>
using the baseless hypothesis that the devil had warped their senses.<br>
The disgusting partiality shown in the accusations was disrelished, as<br>
was the resort that had been had to torture. One poor old man of eighty<br>
they crushed to death because he would plead guilty to nothing. The<br>
authorities quite disregarded the fact that everyone of the<br>
self-accusations had been made in order to escape punishment. These<br>
considerations effected a revolution in the minds of most people.<br>
Remonstrances were presented to the courts, securing reprieve for those<br>
under sentence of death at Salem. This so irritated the despicable<br>
Stoughton that he resigned.<br>
<br>
The forwardness of the ministers therein turned many against the<br>
persecution, After the first victims had fallen at Salem, Governor Phips<br>
took their advice whether or not to proceed. Cotton Mather indited the<br>
reply. It thankfully acknowledges "the success which the merciful God<br>
has given to the sedulous and assiduous endeavors of our honorable<br>
rulers to defeat the abominable witch crafts which have been committed<br>
in the country, humbly praying that the discovery of those mysterious<br>
and mischievous wickednesses may be perfected. It is pleasant to note,<br>
after all, the ministers' advice to the civil rulers not to rely too<br>
much on "the devil's authority"--on the evidence, that is, of those<br>
possessed. The court heeded this injunction all too little, but by and<br>
by it had weight with the public, who judged that, as the trials<br>
appeared to be proceeding on devil's evidence alone, the farce ought to<br>
cease. The Superior Court met in Boston, April 25, 1693, and the grand<br>
Jury declined to find any more bills against persons accused of sorcery.<br>
King William vetoed the Witchcraft Act, and by the middle of 1693 all<br>
the prisoners were discharged.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
THE MIDDLE COLONIES<br>
<br>
[1686]<br>
<br>
The English conquest of New Netherland from the Dutch speedily followed<br>
the Stuarts' return to the throne. Cromwell had mooted an attack on<br>
Dutch America, and, as noticed in Chapter I., Connecticut's charter of<br>
1662 extended that colony to include the Dutch lands. England based her<br>
claim to the territory on alleged priority of discovery, but the real<br>
motives were the value of the Hudson as an avenue for trade, and the<br>
desire to range her colonies along the Atlantic coast in one unbroken<br>
line. The victory was not bloody, nor was it offensive to the Dutch<br>
themselves, who in the matter of liberties could not lose. King Charles<br>
had granted the conquered tract to his brother, the Duke of York,<br>
subsequently James II., and it was in his honor christened with its<br>
present name of New York.<br>
<br>
The Duke's government was not popular, especially as it ordered the<br>
Dutch land-patents to be renewed--for money, of course; and in 1673,<br>
war again existing between England and Holland, the Dutch recovered<br>
their old possession. They held it however for only fifteen months,<br>
since at the Peace of 1674 the two belligerent nations mutually restored<br>
all the posts which they had won.<br>
<br>
The reader already has some idea of Sir Edmond Andros's rule in America.<br>
New York was the first to feel this, coming under the gentleman's<br>
governorship immediately on being the second time surrendered to<br>
England. Such had been the political disorder in the province, that<br>
Andros's headship, stern as it was, proved beneficial. He even, for a<br>
time, 1683-86, reluctantly permitted an elective legislature, though<br>
discontinuing it when the legislatures of New England were suppressed.<br>
This taste of freedom had its effect afterward.<br>
<br>
[1690]<br>
<br>
When news of the Revolution of 1688 in England reached New York, Andros<br>
was in Boston. Nicholson, Lieutenant-Governor, being a Catholic and an<br>
absolutist, and the colony now in horror of all Catholics through fear<br>
of French invasion from Canada, Jacob Leisler, a German adventurer,<br>
partly anticipating, partly obeying the popular wish, assumed to<br>
function in Nicholson's stead. All the aristocracy, English or Dutch,<br>
and nearly all the English of the lower rank were against him. Leisler<br>
was passionate and needlessly bitter toward Catholics, yet he meant<br>
well. He viewed his office as only transitory, and stood ready to<br>
surrender it so soon as the new king's will could be learned; but when<br>
Slaughter arrived with commission as governor, Leisler's foes succeeded<br>
in compassing his execution for treason. This unjust and cruel deed<br>
began a long feud between the popular and the aristocratic party in the<br>
colony.<br>
<br>

<br>
[1700]<br>
<br>
From this time till the American Revolution New York continued a<br>
province of the Crown. Royal governor succeeded royal governor, some of<br>
them better, some worse. Of the entire line Bellomont was the most<br>
worthy official, Cornbury the least so. One of the problems which<br>
chiefly worried all of them was how to execute the navigation acts,<br>
which, evaded everywhere, were here unscrupulously defied. Another care<br>
of the governors, in which they succeeded but very imperfectly, was to<br>
establish the English Church in the colony. A third was the<br>
disfranchisement of Catholics. This they accomplished, the legislature<br>
concurring, and the disability continued during the entire colonial<br>
period.<br>
<br>
Hottest struggle of all occurred over the question of the colony's right<br>
of self-taxation. The democracy stood for this with the utmost<br>
firmness, and even the higher classes favored rather than opposed. The<br>
governors, Cornbury and Lovelace, most frantically, but in vain,<br>
expostulated, scolded, threatened, till at last it became admitted by<br>
law in the colony that no tax whatever could, on any pretext, be levied<br>
save by act of the people's representatives.<br>
<br>
Dutch America, it will be remembered, had reached southward to the<br>
Delaware River, and this lower portion passed with the rest to the Duke<br>
of York in 1664. The territory between the Hudson and the Delaware,<br>
under the name of New Jersey, he made over to Lord Berkeley and Sir<br>
George Carteret, proprietaries, who favored the freest institutions,<br>
civil and religious.&nbsp; The population was for long very sparse and,
as it<br>
grew, very miscellaneous. Dutch, Swedes, English, Quakers, and Puritans<br>
from New England were represented.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/262Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>

<br>
After the English recovery Berkeley disposed of his undivided half of<br>
the province, subsequently set off as West Jersey, to one Bylling, a<br>
Quaker, who in a little time assigned it to Lawrie, Lucas, Penn, and<br>
other Quakers. West Jersey became as much a Quaker paradise as<br>
Pennsylvania. Penn with eleven of his brethren, also bought, of<br>
Carteret's heirs, East Jersey, but here Puritan rather than Quaker<br>
influence prevailed.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/263Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>

<br>
The Jersey plantations came of course under Andros, and after his fall<br>
its proprietors did not recover their political authority. For twelve<br>
years, while they were endeavoring to do this, partial anarchy cursed<br>
the province, and at length in 1702 they surrendered their rights to the<br>
Crown, the Jerseys, now made one, becoming directly subject to Queen<br>
Anne. The province had its own legislature and, till 1741, the same<br>
governors as New York. It also had mainly the same political<br>
vicissitudes, and with the same result.<br>
<br>
William Penn, the famous Quaker, received the proprietorship of<br>
Pennsylvania in payment of a claim for sixteen thousand pounds against<br>
the English Government. This had been left him by his father, Sir<br>
William Penn, a distinguished naval commander in the Dutch war of<br>
1665-67, when he had borne chief part in the conquest of Jamaica.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/264Pic600e.jpg" alt=""><br>

<br>
William Penn was among the most cultivated men of his time, polished by<br>
study and travel, deeply read in law and philosophy. He had fortune, and<br>
many friends at court, including Charles II. himself. He needed but to<br>
conform, and great place was his. But conform he would not. True to the<br>
inner light, braving the scoffs of all his friends, expelled from Oxford<br>
University, beaten from his own father's door, imprisoned now nine<br>
months in London Tower, now six in Newgate, this heroic spirit<br>
persistently went the Quaker way. In despair of securing in England<br>
freedom for distressed consciences he turned his thoughts toward<br>
America, there to try his "holy experiment."<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/265Pic600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>William Penn; From the copy by Francis Race in the<br>
National Museum, Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
The charter from Charles II. was drawn by Penn's own hand and was nobly<br>
liberal. It ordained perfect religious toleration for all Christians,<br>
and forbade taxation save by the provincial assembly or the English<br>
Parliament. Under William and Mary, greatly to his grief, Penn was<br>
forced to sanction the penal laws against Catholics; but they were most<br>
leniently administered, which brought upon the large-minded proprietary<br>
much trouble with the home government.<br>
<br>
As Pennsylvania, owing to the righteous and loving procedure of Penn<br>
toward them, suffered nothing from the red men to the west, so was it<br>
fortunately beyond Andros's jurisdiction on the east. Once, from 1692,<br>
for two years, the land was snatched from Penn and placed under a royal<br>
commission. Returning to England in 1684, after a two years' sojourn in<br>
America to get his colony started, the Quaker chief became intimate and<br>
a favorite with James II., devotedly supporting his Declaration of<br>
Indulgence toward Catholics as well as toward all Protestant dissenters.<br>
He tried hard but vainly to win William and Mary to the same policy.<br>
This attitude of his cost him dear, rendering him an object of suspicion<br>
to the men now in power in England. Twice was he accused of treasonable<br>
correspondence with the exiled James II., though never proved guilty.<br>
From 1699 to 1701 he was in America again, thereafter residing in<br>
England till his death in 1718. He had literally given all for his<br>
colony, his efforts on its behalf having been to him, so he wrote in<br>
1710, a cause of grief, trouble, and poverty.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/268Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>

<br>
But the colony itself was amazingly prosperous. There were internal<br>
feuds, mainly petty, some serious. George Keith grievously divided the<br>
Quakers by his teachings against slavery, going to law, or service as<br>
magistrates on the part of Quakers, thus implying that only infidels or<br>
churchmen could be the colony's officials.<br>
<br>
Fletcher's governorship in 1693-94, under the royal commission, evoked<br>
continual opposition, colonial privileges remaining intact in spite of<br>
him. The people from time to time subjected their ground-law to changes,<br>
only to render it a fitter instrument of freedom. In everything save the<br>
hereditary function of the proprietary, it was democratic. For many<br>
years even the governor's council was elective. The colony grew,<br>
immigrants crowding in from nearly every European country, and wealth<br>
multiplied to correspond.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/270Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>The Penn Mansion in Philadelphia.<br>
<br>
We have, dating from 1698, a history of Pennsylvania by one Gabriel<br>
Thomas, full of interesting information. Philadelphia was already a<br>
"noble and beautiful city," containing above 2,000 houses, most of them<br>
"stately," made of brick; three stores, and besides a town house, a<br>
market house, and several schools. Three fairs were held there yearly,<br>
and two weekly markets, which it required twenty fat bullocks, besides<br>
many sheep, calves, and hogs, to supply. The city had large trade to New<br>
York, New England, Virginia, West India, and Old England. Its exports<br>
were horses, pipe-staves, salt meats, bread-stuffs, poultry, and<br>
tobacco; its imports, fir, rum, sugar, molasses, silver, negroes, salt,<br>
linen, household goods, etc. Wages were three times as high as in<br>
England or Wales. All sorts of "very good paper" were made at<br>
Germantown, besides linen, druggets, crapes, camlets, serges, and other<br>
woollen cloths. All religious confessions were represented.<br>
<br>
In 1712, such his poverty, the good proprietary was willing to sell to<br>
the Crown, but as he insisted upon maintenance of the colonists' full<br>
rights, no sale occurred. English bigots and revenue officials would<br>
gladly have annulled his charter, but his integrity had gotten him<br>
influence among English statesmen, which shielded the heritage he had<br>
left even when he was gone.<br>
<br>
It is particularly to be noticed that till our Independence Delaware was<br>
most intimately related to Pennsylvania. Of Delaware the fee simple<br>
belonged not to Penn, but to the Duke of York, who had conquered it from<br>
the Dutch, as they from the Swedes. Penn therefore governed here, not as<br>
proprietary but as the Duke's tenant. In 1690-92, and from 1702,<br>
Delaware enjoyed a legislature by itself, though its governors were<br>
appointed by Penn or his heirs during the entire colonial period.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, CAROLINA<br>
<br>
[1675]<br>
<br>
The establishment of Charles II. as king fully restored Lord Baltimore<br>
as proprietary in Maryland, and for a long time the colony enjoyed much<br>
peace and prosperity. In 1660 it boasted twelve thousand inhabitants, in<br>
1665 sixteen thousand, in 1676 twenty thousand. Plantation life was<br>
universal, there being no town worthy the name till Baltimore, which,<br>
laid out in 1739, grew very slowly. Tobacco was the main production, too<br>
nearly the only one, the planters sometimes actually suffering for food,<br>
so that the raising of cereals needed to be enforced by law. For long<br>
the weed was also the money of the province, not disused for this even<br>
when paper currency was introduced, being found the less fluctuating in<br>
value of the two. Partly actual over-production and partly the<br>
navigation acts, forcing all sales to be effected through England,<br>
fatally lowered the price, and Maryland with Virginia tried to establish<br>
a "trust" to regulate the output.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/274Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Charles, Second Lord Baltimore.<br>
<br>
In its incessant and on one occasion bloody boundary disputes with<br>
Pennsylvania and Delaware, Maryland had to give in and suffer its<br>
northern and eastern boundaries to be shortened.<br>
<br>
[1689]<br>
<br>
One of the most beautiful traits of early Maryland was its perfect<br>
toleration in religion. Practically neither Pennsylvania nor Rhode<br>
Island surpassed it in this. Much hostility to the Quakers existed, yet<br>
they had here exceptional privileges, and great numbers from Virginia<br>
and the North utilized these. All sorts of dissenters indeed flocked<br>
hither out of all European countries, including many Huguenots, and were<br>
made welcome to all the rights and blessings of the land.<br>
<br>
But from the accession of Charles Calvert, the third Lord Baltimore, in<br>
1675, the colony witnessed continual agitation in favor of establishing<br>
the English Church. False word reached the Privy Council that immorality<br>
was rife in the colony owing to a lack of religious instruction, and<br>
that Catholics were preferred in its offices. This movement succeeded,<br>
in spite of its intrinsic demerit, by passing itself off as part of the<br>
rising in favor of William and Mary in 1688-89.<br>
<br>
[1690]<br>
<br>
James II. had shown no favor to Maryland. If its proprietary, as a<br>
Catholic, pleased him, its civil and religious liberty offended him<br>
more. He was hence not popular here, and the Marylanders would readily<br>
have proclaimed the new monarchs but for the accidental failure of the<br>
proprietary's commands to this effect to reach them. This gave occasion<br>
for one Coode, with a few abettors, to form, in April, 1689, an<br>
"Association in Arms for the Defence of the Protestant Religion, and for<br>
Asserting the Right of King William and Queen Mary to the Province of<br>
Maryland." The exaggerated representations of these conspirators<br>
prevailed in England. The proprietary, retaining his quit rents and<br>
export duty, was deprived of his political prerogatives. Maryland became<br>
a Crown province, Sir Lionel Copley being the first royal governor, and<br>
the Church of England received establishment therein.<br>
<br>
The new ecclesiastical rule did not oppress Protestant dissenters,<br>
though very severe on Catholics, whom it was supposed necessary, here as<br>
all over America, to keep under, lest they should rise in favor of James<br>
II., or his son the Pretender.<br>
<br>
[1660]<br>
<br>
The third Lord Baltimore died in 1714-15. The proprietaries after this<br>
being Protestants, were intrusted again with their old political<br>
headship. By this time a spirit of independence and self-assertion had<br>
grown up among the citizens, enforcing very liberal laws, and the vices<br>
of the sixth Lord, succeeding in 1751, made his subjects more than<br>
willing that he should, as he did, close the proprietary line.<br>
<br>
Virginia, passionately loyal, at first gloried in the Restoration. This<br>
proved premature. It was found that the purely selfish Charles II. cared<br>
no more for Virginia than for Massachusetts. The Commonwealth's men were<br>
displaced from power. Sir William Berkeley again became governor, this<br>
time, however, by the authority of the assembly. A larger feeling of<br>
independence from England had sprung up in the colony in consequence of<br>
recent history at home and in the mother-land. It was developed still<br>
further by the events now to be detailed.<br>
<br>
[1676]<br>
<br>
The Old Dominion contained at this time 40,000 people, 6,000 being white<br>
servants and 2,000 negro slaves, located mainly upon the lower waters of<br>
the Rappahannock, York, and James Rivers. Between 1650 and 1670, through<br>
large immigration from the old country, the population had increased<br>
from 15,000 to 40,000, some of the first families of the State in<br>
subsequent times arriving at this juncture. About eighty ships of<br>
commerce came each year from Great Britain, besides many from New<br>
England. Virginia herself built no ships and owned few; but she could<br>
muster eight thousand horse, had driven the Indians far into the<br>
interior, possessed the capacity for boundless wealth, and had begun to<br>
experience a decided sense of her own rights and importance. The last<br>
fact showed itself in Bacon's Rebellion, which broke out in 1676, just<br>
one hundred years before the Declaration of Independence. The causes of<br>
the insurrection were not far to seek.<br>
<br>
[1673]<br>
<br>
The navigation acts were a sore grievance to Virginia as to the other<br>
colonies. Under Cromwell they had not been much enforced, and the<br>
Virginians had traded freely with all who came. Charles enforced them<br>
with all possible rigor, confining Virginia's trade to England and<br>
English ships manned by Englishmen. This gave England a grinding<br>
monopoly of tobacco, Virginia's sole export, making the planters<br>
commercially the slaves of the home government and of English traders.<br>
Duties on the weed were high, and mercilessly collected without regard<br>
to lowness of price. All supplies from abroad also had to be purchased<br>
in England, at prices set by English sellers. Even if from other parts<br>
of Europe, they must come through England, thus securing her a profit at<br>
Virginia's expense.<br>
<br>
This was not the worst. The colonial government had always been abused<br>
for the ends of worthless office-holders from England. Now it was farmed<br>
out more offensively than ever. In 1673 Charles II. donated Virginia to<br>
two of his favorites, Lords Arlington and Culpeper, to be its<br>
proprietaries like Penn in Pennsylvania and Baltimore in Maryland. They<br>
were to have all the quit rents and other revenues, the nomination of<br>
ministers for parishes, the right of appointing public officers, the<br>
right to own and sell all public or escheated lands; in a word, they now<br>
owned Virginia. This shabby treatment awoke the most intense rage in so<br>
proud a people. The king relented, revoked his donation, made out and<br>
was about to send a new charter. But it was too late; rebellion had<br>
already broken out.<br>
<br>
The Indians having made some attacks on the upper plantations, one<br>
Nathaniel Bacon, a spirited young gentleman of twenty-eight, recently<br>
from England, applied to Sir William Berkeley for a commission against<br>
them. The governor declined to give it, fearing, in the present excited<br>
condition of the colony, to have a body of armed men abroad. Bacon,<br>
enraged, extorts the commission by force. The result is civil war in the<br>
colony. The rebels are for a time completely victorious. Berkeley is<br>
driven to Accomac, on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake, but,<br>
succeeding in capturing a fleet sent to oppose him, he returns with this<br>
and captures Jamestown. Beaten by Bacon in a pitched battle, he again<br>
retires to Accomac, and the colony comes fully under the power of his<br>
antagonist, the colonists agreeing even to fight England should it<br>
interpose on the governor's side, when a decisive change in affairs is<br>
brought about by the rebel leader's death.<br>

<br>
The rebellion was now easily subdued, but it had soured and hardened old<br>
Governor Berkeley's spirit. Twenty-three in all were executed for<br>
participation in the movement. Charles II. remarked: "That old fool has<br>
hanged more men in that naked country than I for the murder of my<br>
father."<br>
<br>
After Bacon's Rebellion the colonial annals show but a dull succession<br>
of royal governors, with few events specially interesting. Under the<br>
governorship of Lord Howard of Effingham, which began in 1684, great<br>
excitement prevailed in Virginia lest King James II. should subvert the<br>
English Church there and make Catholicism dominant, which indeed might<br>
possibly have occurred but for James's abdication in 1688.<br>
<br>
Under Governor Nicholson, from 1690, the capital was removed from<br>
Jamestown to Williamsburg, and the College of William and Mary founded,<br>
its charter dating from 1693. The Attorney-General, Seymour, opposed<br>
this project on the ground that the money was needed for "better<br>
purposes" than educating clergymen. Rev. Dr. Blair, agent and advocate<br>
of the endowment, pleading: "The people have souls to be saved," Seymour<br>
retorted: "Damn your souls, make tobacco." But Blair persisted and<br>
succeeded, himself becoming first president of the college. The initial<br>
commencement exercises took place in 1700.<br>

Governor Spotswood, who came in 1710, did much for Virginia. He built<br>
the first iron furnaces in America, introduced wine-culture, for which<br>
he imported skilled Germans, and greatly interested himself in the<br>
civilization of the Indians. He was the earliest to explore the<br>
Shenandoah Valley. It was also by his energy that the famous pirate<br>
"Black beard" was captured and executed. Lieutenant Maynard, sent with<br>
two ships to hunt him, attacked and boarded the pirate vessel in Pamlico<br>
Sound, 1718. A tough fight at close quarters ensued. Blackbeard was shot<br>
dead, his crew crying for quarter. Thirteen of the men were hung at<br>
Williamsburg. Blackbeard's skull, made into a drinking-cup, is preserved<br>
to this day. The great corsair's fate, Benjamin Franklin, then a<br>
printer's devil in Boston, celebrated in verse.<br>

Carolina was settled partly from England, France, and the Barbadoes, and<br>
partly from New England; but mainly from Virginia, which colony<br>
furthermore furnished most of its political ideas.<br>

<br>
In March, 1663, Carolina was constituted a territory, extending from 36<br>
degrees north latitude southward to the river San Matheo, and assigned<br>
to a company of seven distinguished proprietaries, including General<br>
Monk, who had been created Duke of Albemarle, and John Locke's patron,<br>
the famous Lord Ashley Cooper, subsequently Earl of Shaftesbury.<br>
Governor Sir William Berkeley, of Virginia, was also one of the<br>
proprietaries.<br>

Locke drew up for the province a minute feudal constitution, but it was<br>
too cumbersome to work. Rule by the proprietaries proved radically bad.<br>
They were ignorant, callous to wrongs done by their governors, and<br>
indifferent to everything save their own profits. Many of the settlers<br>
too were turbulent and criminals, fugitives from the justice of other<br>
colonies.&nbsp; The difficulty was aggravated by Indian and Spanish
wars, by<br>
negro slavery, so profitable for rice culture, especially in South<br>
Carolina, by strife between dissenters and churchmen, by the question of<br>
revenue, and by that of representation.<br>

<br>
[1730-1752]<br>
<br>
A proprietary party and a larger popular party were continually at feud,<br>
not seldom with arms, support of the Church allying itself mainly with<br>
the former, dissent with the latter, Zealots for the Church wished to<br>
exclude dissenters from the assembly. Their opponents would keep<br>
Huguenot immigrants, whom the favor of the proprietaries rendered<br>
unwelcome, entirely from the franchise. The popular party passed laws<br>
for electing representatives in every county instead of at Charleston<br>
alone, and for revenue tariffs to pay the debt entailed by war. The<br>
proprietaries vetoed both. They even favored the pirates who harried the<br>
coast. Civil commotions were frequent and growth slow. Interference by<br>
the Crown was therefore most happy. From the time the Carolinas passed<br>
into royal hands, 1729, remarkable prosperity attended them both.<br>
<br>
Assuming charge of Carolina, the Crown reserved to itself the Spanish<br>
frontier, and here, in 1732, it settled Oglethorpe, the able and<br>
unselfish founder of Georgia, under the auspices of an organization in<br>
form much like a mercantile company, but benevolent in aim, whose main<br>
purpose was to open a home for the thousands of Englishmen who were in<br>
prison for debt. Many Scotch and many Austrians also came. Full civil<br>
liberty was promised to all, religious liberty to all but papists.<br>
Political strife was warm here, too, particularly respecting the<br>
admission of rum and slaves. Government by the corporators, though<br>
well-meaning, was ill-informed and a failure, and would have been<br>
ruinous to the colony but for Oglethorpe's genius and exertions. To the<br>
advantage of all, therefore, on the lapse of the charter in 1752,<br>
Georgia, like the Carolinas, assumed the status of a royal colony.<br>

CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE COLONIES<br>
<br>
[1750]<br>
<br>
The political life, habits, and forms familiar to our fathers were such<br>
as their peculiar surroundings and experience had developed out of<br>
English originals. This process and its results form an interesting<br>
study.<br>
<br>
The political unit at the South was the parish; in the North it was the<br>
town. Jury trial prevailed in all the colonies. Local self-government<br>
was vigorous everywhere, yet the most so in the North. The town<br>
regulated its affairs, such as the schools, police, roads, the public<br>
lands, the poor, and in Massachusetts and Connecticut also religion, at<br>
first by pure mass meetings where each citizen represented himself and<br>
which were both legislative and judicial in function, then by combining<br>
these meetings in various ways with the agency of selectmen. Where and<br>
so soon as a colony came to embrace several towns, representative<br>
machinery was set in motion and a colonial legislature formed, having<br>
two chambers nearly everywhere, like Parliament. The county, with the<br>
same character as at present, was instituted later than the oldest towns<br>
and parishes, but itself subsequently became, in thinly settled parts,<br>
the unit of governmental organization and political action, being<br>
divided into towns or parishes only gradually. Voting was subject to a<br>
property qualification, in some colonies to a religious one also; but no<br>
nobility of blood or title got foothold.<br>
<br>
The relation of the colonial governments to England is a far more<br>
perplexing matter. From the preceding chapters it appears that we may<br>
distinguish the colonies, if we come down to about 1750, as either (1)<br>
self-governing or charter colonies, in which liberty was most complete<br>
and subjection to England little more than nominal; and (2)<br>
non-self-governing, ruled, theoretically at any rate, in considerable<br>
measure from outside themselves. Rhode Island and Connecticut made up<br>
the former class. Of the latter there were two groups, the royal or<br>
provincial, including New Hampshire, Massachusetts; New York, New<br>
Jersey, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, and the proprietary, viz.,<br>
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware.<br>
<br>
Yet we are to bear in mind that many important constitutional and<br>
governmental changes had occurred by 1750. Massachusetts, as we have<br>
seen, had ceased to be self-governing as at first, yet it retained a<br>
charter which conferred large liberty. All the provincial colonies began<br>
as proprietary, and all the proprietary were for a time provincial.<br>
<br>
Under Andros, New England stretched from the St. Croix to Delaware Bay.<br>
After 1689 the tendency in all parts of the country was strong toward<br>
civil freedom, which, favored by the changes and apathy of proprietaries<br>
and the ignorance and quarrels of the English ministry, gradually<br>
rendered the other colonies in effect about as well off in this respect<br>
as Rhode Island and Connecticut.<br>
<br>
But unfortunately the legal limits and meaning of this freedom were<br>
never determined. Had they been, our Revolution need not have come.<br>
Monarchs continually attempted to stretch hither the royal prerogative,<br>
but how far this was legal was not then, and never can be, decided. The<br>
constitutional scope of a monarch's prerogative in England itself was<br>
one of the great questions of the seventeenth century, and remained<br>
serious and unsettled through the eighteenth. Applied to America the<br>
problem became angrier still, partly because giving a charter--and the<br>
colonies were all founded on such gift--was an act of prerogative.<br>
<br>
English lawyers never doubted that acts of Parliament were valid in the<br>
colonies. The colonists opposed both the king's and the Parliament's<br>
pretensions, and held their own legislatures to be coordinate with the<br>
Houses at Westminster. They claimed as rights the protection of habeas<br>
corpus, freedom from taxation without their consent, and all the Great<br>
Charter's guarantees. It was the habit of English theorizing on the<br>
subject to allow them these, if at all, as of grace. Repudiating the<br>
pretence that they were represented in Parliament, they likewise denied<br>
all wish to be so, but desired to have colonial legislatures recognized<br>
as concurrent with the English--each colony joined to the mother-country<br>
by a sort of personal union, or through some such tie as exists between<br>
England and her colonies to-day. Massachusetts theorists used as a valid<br>
analogy the relation of ancient Normandy to the French kings. Though no<br>
longer venturing to do so at home, monarchs freely vetoed legislation in<br>
all the colonies except Rhode Island and Connecticut. It was held that<br>
even these colonies were after all somehow subject to England's<br>
oversight.<br>
<br>
On the subject of taxation there was continual dispute,<br>
misunderstanding, recrimination. The colonies did not object to<br>
providing for their own defence. They were willing to do this under<br>
English direction if asked, not commanded. Direct taxation for England's<br>
behoof was never once consented to by America, and till late never<br>
thought of by England. The English navigation laws, however, though<br>
amounting to taxation of America in aid of England, and continually<br>
evaded as unjust, were allowed by the colonies' legislative acts, and<br>
never seriously objected to in any formal way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
SOCIAL CULTURE IN COLONIAL TIMES<br>
<br>
[1750]<br>
<br>
American society rose out of mere untitled humanity; monarchy, guilds,<br>
priests, and all aristocracy of a feudal nature having been left behind<br>
in Europe. The year 1700 found in all the American colonies together<br>
some 300,000 people. They were distributed about as follows: New England<br>
had 115,000; New York, 30,000; New Jersey, 15,000; Pennsylvania and<br>
Delaware, 20,000; Maryland, 35,000; Virginia, 70,000; the Carolina<br>
country, 15,000. Perhaps 50,000 were negro slaves, of whom, say, 10,000<br>
were held north of Mason and Dixon's line. What is now New York City<br>
had, in 1697, 4,302 inhabitants.<br>
<br>
Passing on to 1754, we find the white population of New England<br>
increased to 425,000; that of the middle colonies, including Maryland,<br>
to 457,000; that of Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, to 283,000.<br>
Massachusetts alone now had 207,000; Rhode Island, 35,000; Connecticut,<br>
133,000; New York State (1756), 83,744. There were now not far from<br>
263,000 negroes, of whom 14,000 lived in New England, 4,500 in Rhode<br>
Island. The total population of the thirteen colonies amounted to nearly<br>
a million and a half. At this time Philadelphia about equalled Boston in<br>
size, each having 25,000 inhabitants. At the Revolution Boston had grown<br>
to be the larger. New York, with from 15,000 to 18,000, constituted the<br>
centre of trade and of politics. The city and county of New York<br>
together numbered 13,046 inhabitants in 1756; 21,862 in 1771; 23,614 in<br>
1786. The whole State, in 1771 had 146,144. Connecticut, in 1774, had<br>
197,856. There are said to have been, so late as 1763, woods where the<br>
New York City Hall now stands.<br>
<br>
From North to South the population decreased in density, but it<br>
increased in heterogeneity and non-English elements, and in illiteracy.<br>
The South had also the stronger aristocratic feeling. Slaves, as the<br>
above figures show, were far more numerous in that section. Their<br>
condition was also worse there.<br>
<br>
A large proportion of the white population everywhere was of<br>
Saxon-Teutonic blood. The colonial leaders, and many others, at least in<br>
the North, were men who would have been eminent in England itself. Not a<br>
few New England theologians and lawyers were peers to the ablest of<br>
their time. Numbers of the common people read, reflected, debated. While<br>
profoundly religious, the colonists, being nearly all Protestants, were<br>
bold and progressive thinkers in every line, prizing discussion,<br>
preferring to settle questions by rational methods rather than through<br>
authority and tradition. We have observed that there are exceptions to<br>
this rule, like the treatment of Roger Williams, but they were<br>
exceptions. The colonists possessed in eminent degree energy,<br>
determination, power of patient endurance and sacrifice. Their political<br>
genius, too, was striking in itself, and it becomes surprising if one<br>
compares Germany, in the unspeakable distraction of the Thirty Years'<br>
War, with America at the same period, 1618-1648, successfully solving by<br>
patience and debate the very problems which were Germany's despair.<br>

<br>
In all the southern colonies the English Church was established, a<br>
majority of the people its members, its clergy supported by tithes and<br>
glebe. William and Mary secured it a sort of establishment also in New<br>
York and Maryland. Yet at no moment of the colonial period was there a<br>
bishop in America. No church building was consecrated with episcopal<br>
rites, no resident of America taken into orders without going to London.<br>
[footnote: See, for these facts, The Century for May, 1888.]&nbsp; Even
in<br>
Virginia, till a very late colonial period, the clergy retained many<br>
Puritan forms. Some would not read the Common Prayer. For more than a<br>
hundred years the surplice was apparently unknown there, sacraments<br>
administered without the proper ornaments and vessels, parts of the<br>
liturgy omitted, marriages, baptisms, churchings, and funerals<br>
solemnized in private houses. In some parishes, so late as 1724, the<br>
communion was partaken sitting. Excellent as were many of the clergymen,<br>
there were some who never preached, and not a few even bore an ill name.<br>
It was worst in Maryland, and "bad as a Maryland parson" became a<br>
proverb. The yearly salary in the best Virginia parishes was tobacco of<br>
about 100 pounds value.<br>
<br>
The Carolina clergy at first formed a superior class, as nearly all the<br>
early ministers were men carefully selected and sent out from England by<br>
the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Here there was special<br>
interest in the religious welfare of the slaves. All Over the South the<br>
Church ministers owed much to competition with those of sects,<br>
especially those of the Presbyterians, to which body belonged many of<br>
the Scotch and Irish immigrants after 1700. Dissent was dominant<br>
everywhere at the North. A vast majority of the people even in New York<br>
were dissenters, though the Episcopal clergy there successfully resisted<br>
all efforts against the Church tax, notwithstanding the fact that the<br>
same injustice in Massachusetts and Connecticut oppressed their brethren<br>
in those colonies. The New York clergy also fought every sort of liberal<br>
law, as to enable dissenting bodies of Christians to hold property. It<br>
was in good degree this attitude of theirs that filled the country,<br>
Virginia too, with such hatred of bishops.<br>
<br>
But this spirit was fully matched by that of the Independent ministers<br>
in New England. Their dissent was aggressive, persecuting, puritanical.<br>
Meeting-houses were cold, sermons long and dry, music vocal only.<br>
Religious teaching and the laws it procured, foolishly assumed to<br>
regulate all the acts of life. Extravagance was denounced and fined. In<br>
1750, the Massachusetts Assembly forbade theatres as "likely to<br>
encourage immorality and impiety." Rhode Island took similar action in<br>
1762.<br>
<br>

The ministers of Boston viewed bishops almost as emissaries of the<br>
devil. Herein in fact lay the primary, some have thought the deepest and<br>
most potent cause of the Revolution, since kings and the bishops of<br>
London incessantly sought to establish Anglicanism in Massachusetts, and<br>
English politicians deemed it outrageous that conformists should be<br>
denied any of that colony's privileges. For some time, under William and<br>
Mary's charter, in this province where Congregationalism had till now<br>
had everything its own way, only Church clergymen could celebrate<br>
marriage. In New York and Maryland, too, hostility to the establishment<br>
greatly stimulated disloyalty. This was true even in Anglican Virginia,<br>
where the Church found it no easier to keep power than it was in<br>
Massachusetts to get power, and where the clergy were unpopular,<br>
concerned more for tithes than for souls.<br>
<br>

<br>
Colleges were founded early in several colonies. Harvard dates from<br>
1638; William and Mary, in Virginia, from 1693; Yale, from 1701; the<br>
College of New Jersey, from 1746, its old Nassau Hall, built in 1756 and<br>
named in honor of William III. of the House of Nassau, being then the<br>
largest structure in British America. The University of Pennsylvania<br>
dates from 1753; King's College, now Columbia, from 1754; Rhode Island<br>
College, now Brown University, from 1764. Educational facilities in<br>
general varied greatly with sections, being miserable in the southern<br>
colonies, fair in the central, excellent in the northern. In Virginia,<br>
during the period now under our survey, schools were almost unknown. In<br>
Maryland, from 1728, a free school was established by law in each<br>
county. These were the only such schools in the South before 1770.<br>
Philadelphia and New York had good schools by 1700; rural Pennsylvania<br>
none of any sort till 1750, then only the poorest. A few New York and<br>
New Jersey towns of New England origin had free schools before the<br>
Revolution. Many Southern planters sent their sons to school in England.<br>
In popular education New England led not only the continent but the<br>
world, there being a school-house, often several, in each town. Every<br>
native adult in Massachusetts and Connecticut was able to read and<br>
write. In this matter Rhode Island was far behind its next neighbors.<br>
<br>
Newspapers were distributed much as schools were. The first<br>
printing-press was set up at Cambridge in 1639. The first newspaper,<br>
Publick Occurrences Foreign and&nbsp; Domestic, was started in Boston in<br>
1690. The first permanent newspaper, the Boston News Letter, began in<br>
1704, and it had a Boston and a Philadelphia rival in 1719. The Maryland<br>
Gazette was started at Annapolis in 1727, a weekly at Williamsburg, Va.,<br>
in 1736. In 1740 there were eleven newspapers in all in the colonies;<br>
one each in New York, South Carolina, and Virginia (from 1736), three in<br>
Pennsylvania, one of them German, and five in Boston. The Connecticut<br>
Gazette was started at New Haven in 1755; The Summary, at New London in<br>
1758. The Rhode Island Gazette was begun by James Franklin, September<br>
27, 1732, but was not permanent. The Providence Gazette and Country<br>
Journal put forth its first issue October 20, 1762. In 1775, Salem,<br>
Newburyport, and Portsmouth had each its newspaper. The first daily in<br>
the country, the Pennsylvania Packet, began in 1784.<br>
<br>

Other literature of American origin flourished in New England nearly<br>
alone. It consisted of sermons, social and political tracts, poetry,<br>
history, and memoirs. The clergy were the chief but not the sole<br>
authors. Of readers, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston had many.<br>
Much reading matter came from England. Charleston enjoyed a public<br>
library from 1700. About 1750 there were several others. That left to<br>
Philadelphia in 1751, by James Logan, comprised 4,000 volumes.<br>
<br>
William and Mary had established a postal system for America, placing<br>
Thomas Neale, Esquire, at its head. The service hardly became a system<br>
till 1738. In ordinary weather a post-rider would receive the<br>
Philadelphia mail at the Susquehannah River on Saturday evening, be at<br>
Annapolis on Monday, reach the Potomac Tuesday night, on Wednesday<br>
arrive at New Post, near Fredericksburg, and by Saturday evening at<br>
Williamsburg, whence, once a month, the mail went still farther south,<br>
to Edenton, N. C. Thus a letter was just a week in transit between<br>
Philadelphia and the capital of Virginia. In New England, from here to<br>
New York, and between New York and Philadelphia, despatch was much<br>
better.<br>

The learned professions also were best patronized and had the ablest<br>
personnel in New England, where all three, but particularly the clergy,<br>
were strong and honored. Outside of New England, till 1750, lawyers and<br>
physicians, especially in the country parts, were poorly educated and<br>
little respected. Each formidable disease had the people at its mercy.<br>
Diphtheria, then known as the throat disease, swept through the land<br>
once in about thirty years. Smallpox was another frequent scourge. In<br>
1721 it attacked nearly six thousand persons in Boston, about half the<br>
population, killing some nine hundred. The clergy, almost to a man,<br>
decried vaccination when first vented, proclaiming it an effort to<br>
thwart God's will. Clergymen, except perhaps in Carolina and Virginia,<br>
were somewhat better educated, yet those in New England led all others<br>
in this respect.<br>
<br>
Colonial America boasted many great intellectual lights. President<br>
Edwards won European reputation as a thinker, and so did Franklin as a<br>
statesman and as a scientist. Linnaeus named our Bartram, a Quaker<br>
farmer of Pennsylvania, the greatest natural botanist then living.<br>
Increase Mather read and wrote both Greek and Hebrew, and spoke Latin.<br>
He and his son Cotton were veritable wonders in literary attainment. The<br>
one was the author of ninety-two books, the other of three hundred and<br>
eighty-three. The younger Winthrop was a member of the Royal Society.<br>
Copley, Stuart, and West became distinguished painters.<br>
<br>
Except for mails, there were in the colonies no public conveyances by<br>
land till just before the Revolution. After stage lines were introduced,<br>
to go from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh required seven days; from<br>
Philadelphia to New York, at first three, later two. The earliest coach<br>
to attain the last-named speed was advertised as "the flying machine,"<br>
From Boston one would be four days travelling to New York, two to<br>
Portsmouth. Packet-boats between the main points on the coast were as<br>
regular and speedy as wind allowed. Stage-drivers, inn-keepers, and<br>
ship-captains were the honored and accredited purveyors of news.<br>
<br>
Everywhere was great prosperity, little luxury. Paucity of money gave<br>
rise to that habit of barter and dicker in trade which was a mannerism<br>
of our fathers. Agriculture formed the basal industry, especially in the<br>
Southern colonies; yet in New England and Pennsylvania both manufactures<br>
and commerce thrived. Pennsylvania's yearly foreign commerce exceeded<br>
1,000,000 pounds sterling, requiring 500 vessels and more than 7,000<br>
seamen. From Pennsylvania, in 1750, 3,000 tons of pig-iron were<br>
exported. The annual production of iron in Maryland just before the<br>
Revolution reached 25,000 tons of pig, 500 of bar. The business of<br>
marine insurance began in this country at Philadelphia in 1721, fire<br>
insurance at Boston in 1724. New England produced timber, ships, rum,<br>
paper, hats, leather, and linen and woollen cloths, the first three for<br>
export.<br>
<br>
In country places houses were poor save on the great estates, south, but<br>
in the cities there were many fine mansions before 1700. From this year<br>
stoves began to be used. Glass windows and paper hangings were first<br>
seen not far from 1750.<br>
<br>
The colonists ate much flesh, and nearly all used tobacco and liquor<br>
freely. Finest ladies snuffed, sometimes smoked. Little coffee was<br>
drunk, and no tea till about 1700. Urban life was social and gay. In the<br>
country the games of fox and geese, three and twelve men morris, husking<br>
bees and quilting bees were the chief sports. Tableware was mostly of<br>
wood, though many had pewter, and the rich much silver. The people's<br>
ordinary dress was of homemade cloth, but not a few country people still<br>
wore deerskin. The clothing of the rich was imported, and often gaudy<br>
with tasteless ornament. Wigs were common in the eighteenth century, and<br>
all head-dress stupidly elaborate.<br>
<br>
William Lang, of Boston, advertises in 1767 to provide all who wish with<br>
wigs "in the most genteel and polite taste," assuring judges, divines,<br>
lawyers, and physicians, "because of the importance of their heads, that<br>
he can assort his wigs to suit their respective occupations and<br>
inclinations." He tells the ladies that he can furnish anyone of them<br>
with "a nice, easy, genteel, and polite construction of rolls, such as<br>
may tend to raise their heads to any pitch they desire."<br>
<br>
"Everybody wore wigs in 1750, except convicts and slaves. Boys wore<br>
them, servants wore them, Quakers wore them, paupers wore them. The<br>
making of wigs was an important branch of industry in Great Britain.<br>
Wigs were of many styles and prices. Some dangled with curls; and they<br>
were designated by a great variety of names, such as tyes, bobs, majors,<br>
spencers, foxtails, twists, tetes, scratches, full-bottomed dress bobs,<br>
cues, and perukes. The people of Philadelphia dressed as the actors of<br>
our theatres now dress in old English comedy. They walked the streets in<br>
bright-colored and highly decorated coats, three-cornered hats, ruffled<br>
shirts and wristbands, knee-breeches, silk stockings, low shoes, and<br>
silver buckles." [footnote: Mrs. M. J. Lamb, in Magazine of Am. History,<br>
August. 1888.]&nbsp; Lord Stirling, one of Washington's generals, had a<br>
clothing inventory like a king: a "pompidou" cloth coat and vest,<br>
breeches with gold lace, a crimson and figured velvet coat, seven<br>
scarlet vests, et cetera, et cetera.<br>
<br>
The wigs encountered the zealous hostility of many, among these Judge<br>
Samuel Sewall. His highest eulogy on a departed worthy was: "The welfare<br>
of the poor was much upon his spirit, and he abominated periwigs." A<br>
member of the church at Newbury, Mass., refused to attend communion<br>
because the pastor wore a wig, believing that all who were guilty of<br>
this practice would be damned if they did not repent. A meeting of<br>
Massachusetts Quakers solemnly expressed the conviction that the wearing<br>
of extravagant and superfluous wigs was wholly contrary to the truth.<br>
<br>

<big><big>Chief Justice Sewall.<br>
<br>
There was an aristocracy, of its kind, in all the colonies, but it was<br>
far the strongest in the South. Social lines were sharply drawn, an<br>
"Esquire" not liking to be accosted as "Mr.," and each looking down<br>
somewhat upon a simple "Goodman." These gradations stood forth in<br>
college catalogues and in the location of pews in churches. The Yale<br>
triennial catalogue until 1767 and the Harvard triennial till 1772<br>
arrange students' names not alphabetically or according to attainments,<br>
but so as to indicate the social rank of their families. Memoranda of<br>
President Clap, of Yale, against the names of youth when admitted to<br>
college, such as "Justice of the Peace," "Deacon," "of middling estate<br>
much impoverished," reveal how hard it sometimes was properly to grade<br>
students socially. At the South, regular mechanics, like all free<br>
laborers, were few and despised. The indentured servants, very numerous<br>
in several colonies, differed little from slaves. David Jamieson,<br>
attorney-general of New York in 1710, had been banished from Scotland as<br>
a Covenanter and sold in New Jersey as a four years' redemptioner to pay<br>
transportation expanses. Such servants were continually running away,<br>
which may have aided in abolishing the system. Paupers and criminals<br>
were fewest in New England. All the colonies imprisoned insolvent<br>
criminals, though dirt and damp made each prison a hell. All felonies<br>
were awarded capital punishment, and many minor crimes incurred<br>
barbarous penalties. Whipping-post, pillory, and stocks were in frequent<br>
use. So late as 1760 women were publicly whipped. At Hartford, in 1761,<br>
David Campbell and Alexander Pettigrew, for the burglary of two watches,<br>
received each fifteen stripes, the loss of the right ear, and the<br>
brand-mark "B" on the forehead. Pettigrew came near losing his life from<br>
the profuse bleeding which ensued. A husband killing his wife was<br>
hanged. A wife killing her husband was burned, as were slaves who slew<br>
their masters.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/321Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>The Pillory.<br>
<br>
In care for the unfortunate and in the study and in all applications of<br>
social science, Philadelphia led. The Pennsylvania Hospital, the first<br>
institution of the kind in America, was founded in 1751. The<br>
Philadelphia streets were the first to be lighted; those of New York<br>
next; those of Boston not till 1773. Before the end of the period now<br>
before us Philadelphia and New York also had night patrols.<br>

<br>
ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN AMERICA<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/323Pic_600e2.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Totem of the Sioux.<br>
<br>
[1659-1672]<br>
<br>
Working upward from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the source of this<br>
and of the Mississippi, and then down the latter river, Franciscans and<br>
Jesuits their pioneers, braving dreadful hardships and dangers in<br>
efforts, more courageous than successful, to convert the Indians, the<br>
French had come to control that great continental highway and boldly to<br>
claim for France the entire heart of North America.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/324Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>A Sioux Chief.<br>
<br>
In 1659, Groseilliers and Radisson penetrated beyond Lake Superior, and<br>
dwelt for a time among the Sioux, who knew of the Mississippi River.<br>
Next year Groseilliers went thither again, accompanied by the Jesuit<br>
Menard and his servant, Guerin. In 1661 Menard and Guerin pushed into<br>
what is now Wisconsin, and may have seen the Mississippi. These<br>
explorations made the French familiar with the copper mines of Lake<br>
Superior, and awakened the utmost zeal to see the Great River of which<br>
the Indians spoke. La Salle probably discovered the Ohio in 1670, and<br>
traced it down to the falls at Louisville. His main eulogist holds that<br>
he even reached the Mississippi at that time, some three years earlier<br>
than Joliet, but this is not substantiated. We also reject the belief<br>
that he reached the stream by way of the Chicago portage in 1671.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/325Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Totem of the Illinois.<br>
<br>
[1676]<br>
<br>
In 1672 Count Frontenac, Governor of New France, despatched Louis Joliet<br>
to discover the Great River. He reached the Strait of Mackinaw in<br>
December, and there Pere Marquette joined him. In May, next year, they<br>
paddled their canoes up the Fox River and tugged them across the portage<br>
into the Wisconsin, which they descended, entering the Father of Waters<br>
June 17, 1673. They floated down to the mouth of the Arkansas and then<br>
returned, their journey back being up the Illinois and Desplaines<br>
Rivers. Joliet gave his name to the peak on the latter stream which the<br>
city of Joliet, Ill., near by, still retains. Joliet arrived at Quebec<br>
in August, 1674, having in four months journeyed over twenty-five<br>
hundred miles.<br>
<br>
It thus became known how close the upper waters of the great rivers, St.<br>
Lawrence and Mississippi, were to each other, and that the latter<br>
emptied into the Gulf of Mexico instead of the South Sea (Pacific); yet,<br>
as the Rocky Mountains had not then been discovered, it was for long<br>
believed that some of the western tributaries of the Great River led to<br>
that western ocean.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/327Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>The Reception of Joliet and Marquette by the Illinois.<br>
<br>
[1682]<br>
<br>
In 1676 Raudin, and three years later,&nbsp; Du Lhut, visited the
Ojibwas and<br>
Sioux west of Lake Superior. Du Lhut reached the upper waters of the<br>
Mississippi at Sandy Lake. He went there again in 1680. In 1682 La Salle<br>
crossed the Chicago portage and explored the lower Mississippi all the<br>
way to the Gulf, taking possession of the entire valley in the name of<br>
France and naming it Louisiana. Nicholas Perrot travelled by way of the<br>
Fox and Wisconsin Rivers to the upper Mississippi in 1685, and again in<br>
1688. It is in his writings that the word "Chicago" first appears in<br>
literature.<br>
<br>
There were thus between the two great valleys, 1, the Superior route; 2,<br>
the Wisconsin and Fox route; 3, the Illinois River route, whether by the<br>
Kankakee, La Salle's way, or by the south branch of the Chicago River,<br>
Joliet's way; and 4, the route by the Wabash and Ohio. The Wabash, too,<br>
could be approached either from Lake Erie or from Lake Michigan, through<br>
St. Joseph's River. At high water, canoes often passed from Lake<br>
Michigan into the Mississippi without portage.<br>
<br>

<big><big>A Part of the Map Published in Paris by Thevenot as<br>
"Marquette's Map." It shows the route taken by Joliet across Wisconsin<br>
from the Baie des Puans (now Green Bay) to the Mississippi River, also<br>
part of the return journey, that is, from the present site of Chicago,<br>
northward along lake Michigan.<br>
<br>
[1685-1690]<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/331Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>&nbsp; Louis XIV.<br>
<br>
La Salle had the ambition to get to the South Sea from the Mississippi.<br>
Governor De la Barre, who followed Frontenac, opposing him, he repaired<br>
to France, where he succeeded in winning Louis XIV. to his plan. At the<br>
head of a well-equipped fleet he sailed for the mouth of the<br>
Mississippi, reaching land near Matagorda Bay on the first day of the<br>
year 1685. Not finding the Mississippi, La Salle's officers mutinied.<br>
<br>
</big></big><big><big>The expedition broke up into parties, wandering
here and
there,<br>
distressed by Indian attacks and by treachery among themselves. La Salle<br>
was shot by his own men. Nearly all his followers perished, but a small<br>
party at last discovered the river and ascended it to Fort St. Louis on<br>
the Illinois, reaching France via Quebec.&nbsp; In this expedition
France<br>
took possession of Texas, nor did she ever relinquish the claim till, in<br>
1763, the whole of Louisiana west of the Mississippi was ceded to Spain,<br>
La Salle's ill-starred attempt led later to the planting of French<br>
colonies by D'Iberville at Biloxi Island, in Mobile Bay, soon abandoned,<br>
and at Poverty Point, on the Mississippi; and still later to the<br>
settlement of New Orleans and vicinity. Growth in these parts was slow,<br>
however. So late as 1713 there were not over three hundred whites in the<br>
entire Mississippi Valley.<br>

<br>
By this time French traders had set foot on every shore of the great<br>
lakes and explored nearly every stream tributary thereto. The English,<br>
pushing westward more and more, were trying to divide with them the<br>
lucrative business of fur-trading, and each nation sought to win to<br>
itself all the Indians it could. The Mohawks and their confederates of<br>
the Five Nations, now equipped and acquainted with fire-arms, spite of<br>
alternate overtures and threats from the French, remained firm friends<br>
to the English, who more and more invaded those vast and fertile western<br>
ranges. It grew to be the great question of the age this side the<br>
Atlantic, whether England or France should control the continent. King<br>
William's war, declared in 1689, was therefore certain to rage in<br>
America as well as in Europe.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/335Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Signature of D'Iberville.<br>
<br>
One sees by a glance at the map what advantage France had in this<br>
struggle. It possessed the best fishing grounds and fur-producing<br>
districts, and fish and furs were at first the only exports of value<br>
from the north of America. The French, too, held all the water-ways to<br>
the heart of the continent. Coming up Lake Champlain they could threaten<br>
New York and New England from the rear. The colonies farther south they<br>
shut in almost as straitly, French bullets whistling about any<br>
Englishman's ears the instant he appeared beyond the mountains.<br>
<br>
In other respects England had the advantage. In population English<br>
America had become as superior as French America was territorially,<br>
having 1,116,000 white inhabitants in 1750, to about 80,000 French. The<br>
English colonies were also more convenient to the mother-country, and<br>
the better situated for commerce both coastwise and across the ocean.<br>
Among the English, temper for mere speculation and adventure decayed<br>
very early, giving way to the conviction that successful planting<br>
depended wholly upon persistent, energetic toil.<br>
<br>
A piece of fortune more important yet was their relatively free<br>
religious and political system. Toleration in religion was large.<br>
Self-government was nearly complete internally, and indeed externally,<br>
till the navigation acts. Canada, on the other hand, was oppressed by a<br>
feudal constitution in the state, settlers being denied the fee simple<br>
of their lands, and by Jesuits in Church. "New France could not grow,"<br>
says Parkman, "with a priest on guard at the gate to let in none but<br>
such as pleased him. In making Canada a citadel of the state religion,<br>
the clerical monitors of the Crown robbed their country of a<br>
transatlantic empire." Thus the Huguenots, France's best emigrants to<br>
America, did not come to New France, but to New England and the other<br>
Protestant colonies.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/337Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>The Attack on Schenectady.<br>
<br>
The Indian hostilities which heralded King William's War began August<br>
13, 1688. Frontenac prepared to capture Albany and even Manhattan. He<br>
did not accomplish so much; but on the night of February 8, 1689-90, his<br>
force of ninety Iroquois and over a hundred Frenchmen fell upon<br>
Schenectady, killed sixty, and captured eighty or ninety more. Only a<br>
corporal's guard escaped to Albany with the sad news. This attack had<br>
weighty influence, as occasioning the first American congress. Seven<br>
delegates from various colonies assembled at New York on May 1, 1690, to<br>
devise defence against the northern invaders.<br>
<br>
The eastern Indians were hardly at rest from Philip's War when roused by<br>
the French to engage in this. An attack was made upon Haverhill, Mass.,<br>
and Hannah Dustin, with a child only a few days old, another woman, and<br>
a boy, was led captive to an Indian camp up the Merrimac. The savages<br>
killed the infant, but thereby steeled the mother's heart for revenge.<br>
One night the three prisoners slew their sleeping guards and, seizing a<br>
canoe, floated down to their home. Dover was attacked June 27, 1689,<br>
twenty-three persons killed, and twenty-nine sold to the French in<br>
Canada. Indescribable horrors occurred at Oyster River, at Salmon Falls,<br>
at Casco, at Exeter, and elsewhere.<br>

<big><big>Hannah Dustin's Escape.<br>

[1702]<br>
<br>
In 1702 Queen Anne's War began, and in this again New England was the<br>
chief sufferer. The barbarities which marked it were worse than those of<br>
Philip's War. De Rouville, with a party of French and savages, proceeded<br>
from Canada to Deerfield, Mass. Fearing an attack, the villagers meant<br>
to be vigilant, but early on a February morning, 1704, the wily enemy,<br>
skulking till the sentinels retired at daylight, managed to effect a<br>
surprise. Fifty were killed and one hundred hurried off to Canada. Among<br>
these were the minister, Mr. Williams, and his family. Twenty years<br>
later a white woman in Indian dress entered Deerfield. It was one of the<br>
Williams daughters. She had married an Indian in Canada, and now refused<br>
to desert him. Cases like this, of which there were many in the course<br>
of these frightful wars, seemed to the settlers harder to bear than<br>
death. Massachusetts came so to dread the atrocious foe, that fifteen<br>
pounds were offered by public authority for an Indian man's scalp, eight<br>
for a child's or a woman's.<br>
<br>
[1705]<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/341Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Plan of Port Royal, Nova Scotia.<br>
</big></big><big><big><br>
Governor Spotswood urged aggression on the French to the west; Governor<br>
Hunter of New York had equal zeal for a movement northward. New York<br>
raised 600 men and the same number of Iroquois, voting 10,000 pounds of<br>
paper money for their sustenance. Connecticut and New Jersey sent 1,600<br>
men. A force of 4,000 in all mustered at Albany under Nicholson of New<br>
York. They were to co-operate against Montreal with the naval expedition<br>
of 1711, commanded by Sir Hoveden Walker. Walker failed ignominiously,<br>
and Nicholson, hearing of this betimes, saved himself by retreating.<br>
<br>
Sir William Phips had captured Port Royal in 1690, and Acadia was<br>
annexed to Massachusetts in 1692. In 1691 the French again took formal<br>
possession of Port Royal and the neighboring country. In 1692 an<br>
ineffectual attempt was made to recover it, but by the Treaty of<br>
Ryswick, 1697, it was explicitly given back to France.<br>
<br>
[1710]<br>
<br>
At the inception of Queen Anne's War, in 1702, there were several<br>
expeditions from New England to Nova Scotia; in 1704 and 1707 without<br>
result. That of 1710 was more successful. It consisted of four regiments<br>
and thirty-six vessels, besides troop and store ships and some marines.<br>
Port Royal capitulated, and its name was changed to Annapolis, in honor<br>
of Queen Anne. Acadia never again came under French control, and was<br>
regularly ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht, 1713.<br>
Notwithstanding this, however, French America still remained<br>
substantially intact.<br>
<br>
</big></big><img src="images/343Pic_600e.jpg" alt=""><br>
<big><big>Queen Anne.<br>
<br>
[1714]<br>
<br>
If the great struggle for the Ohio Valley now became a silent one, it<br>
was none the less earnest. Spotswood had opened a road across the Blue<br>
Ridge in 1716. In 1721 New Yorkers began settling on Oswego River, and<br>
they finished a fort there by 1726. Closer alliance was formed with the<br>
Five Nations. The French governor of Quebec in 1725 pleaded that Niagara<br>
must be fortified, and on his successor was urged the necessity of<br>
reducing the Oswego garrison. It was partly to flank Oswego that the<br>
French pushed up Lake Champlain to Crown Point and built Fort St.<br>
Frederick.<br>
<br>
The Treaty of Utrecht had left Cape Breton Island to France. The French<br>
at once strongly fortified Louisburg and invited thither the French<br>
inhabitants of Acadia and Newfoundland, which had also been ceded to<br>
Great Britain. Many went, though the British governors did much to<br>
hinder removal. This irritated the French authorities, and the Indian<br>
atrocities of 1723-24 at Dover and in Maine are known to have been<br>
stimulated from Montreal. Father Rasle, an astute and benevolent French<br>
Jesuit who had settled among the Indians at Norridgewock, became an<br>
agent of this hostile influence. In an English attack, August 12, 1724,<br>
Rasle's settlement was broken up and himself killed. The Indians next<br>
year made a treaty, and peace prevailed till King George's War.<br>

<big><big>Sir William Pepperrell.<br>
<br>
This opened in 1744, England against France once more, and in 1745 came<br>
the capture of Louisburg, then the Gibraltar of America. This was<br>
brought about through the energy of Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts,<br>
the most efficient English commander this side the Atlantic. That<br>
commonwealth voted to send 3,250 men, Connecticut 500, New Hampshire and<br>
Rhode Island each 300. Sir William Pepperrell, of Kittery, Me.,<br>
commanded, Richard Gridley, of Bunker Hill fame, being his chief of<br>
artillery. The expedition consisted of thirteen armed vessels, commanded<br>
by Captain Edward Tyng, with over 200 guns, and about ninety transports.<br>
The Massachusetts troops sailed from Nantasket March 24th, and reached<br>
Canso, April 4th. "Rhode Island," says Hutchinson, "waited until a<br>
better judgment could be made of the event, their three hundred not<br>
arriving until after the place had surrendered." The expedition was very<br>
costly to the colonies participating, and four years later England<br>
reimbursed them in the sum of 200,000 pounds. Yet at the disgraceful<br>
peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, she surrendered Louisburg and all<br>
Cape Breton to France again.<br>
<br>
[1746-1748]<br>
<br>
In 1746 French and Indians from Crown Point destroyed the fort and<br>
twenty houses at Saratoga, killing thirty persons, and capturing sixty.<br>
Orders came this year from England to advance on Crown Point and<br>
Montreal, upon Shirley's plan, all the colonies as far south as Virginia<br>
being commanded to aid. Quite an army mustered at Albany. Sir William<br>
Johnson succeeded in rousing the Iroquois, whom the French had been<br>
courting with unprecedented assiduity. But D'Anville's fleet threatened.<br>
The colonies wanted their troops at home. Inactivity discouraged the<br>
soldiers, alienated the Indians. At last news came that the Canada<br>
project was abandoned, and in 1748 the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was<br>
declared.<br>
<br>
This very year France began new efforts to fill the Ohio Valley with<br>
emigrants. Virginia did the same. To anticipate the English, the French<br>
sent Bienville to bury engraved leaden plates at the mouths of streams.<br>
They also fortified the present sites of Ogdensburg and Toronto. Even<br>
now, therefore, France's power this side the Atlantic was not visibly<br>
shaken. The continental problem remained unsolved.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX.<br>
<br>
THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR<br>
<br>
[1748]<br>
<br>
The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had been made only because the contestants<br>
were tired of fighting. In America, at least, each at once began taking<br>
breath and preparing to renew the struggle. Not a year passed that did<br>
not witness border quarrels more or less bloody. The French authorities<br>
filled the Ohio and Mississippi valleys with military posts; English<br>
settlers pressed persistently into the same to find homes. In this<br>
movement Virginia led, having in 1748 formed, especially to aid western<br>
settlement, the Ohio Company, which received from the king a grant of<br>
five hundred thousand acres beyond the Alleghanies. A road was laid out<br>
between the upper Potomac and the present Pittsburgh, settlements were<br>
begun along it, and efforts made to conciliate the savages.<br>

<br>
One of the frontier villages was at what is now Franklin, Penn., and the<br>
location involved Virginia with the colony of Pennsylvania. As<br>
commissioner to settle the dispute George Washington was sent out.<br>
<br>
The future Father of his Country was of humble origin. Born in<br>
Westmoreland County, Va., "about ten in ye morning of ye 11th day of<br>
February, 1731-32," as recorded in his mother's Bible, he had been an<br>
orphan from his earliest youth. His education was of the slenderest. At<br>
sixteen he became a land surveyor, leading a life of the roughest sort,<br>
beasts, savages, and hardy frontiersmen his constant companions,<br>
sleeping under the sky and cooking his own coarse food. No better man<br>
could have been chosen to thread now the Alleghany trail.<br>
<br>
Washington reported the French strongly posted in western Pennsylvania<br>
on lands claimed by the Ohio Company. Virginia fitted out an expedition<br>
to dislodge them. Of this Washington commanded the advance. Meeting at<br>
Great Meadows the French under Contrecoeur, commander of Fort Du Quesne<br>
(Pittsburgh); he was at first victorious, but the French were<br>
re-enforced before he was, and Washington, after a gallant struggle, had<br>
to capitulate.&nbsp; This was on July 3, 1754. The French and Indian
War had<br>
begun.<br>

<br>
[1755]<br>
<br>
The English Government bade the colonies defend their frontier, and in<br>
this interest twenty-five delegates from the seven northern colonies met<br>
at Albany on June 19, 1754. Benjamin Franklin represented Pennsylvania,<br>
and it was at this conference that he presented his well-considered<br>
plan, to be described in our chapter on Independence, for a general<br>
government over English America. The Albany Convention amounted to<br>
little, but did somewhat to renew alliance with the Six Nations.<br>
[footnote: Increased from five to six by the accession of the<br>
Tuscaroras.]<br>
<br>
In this decisive war England had in view four great objects of conquest<br>
in America: 1. Fort Du Quesne; 2. The Ontario basin with Oswego and Fort<br>
Niagara; 3. The Champlain Valley; 4. Louisburg. The British ministry<br>
seemed in earnest. It sent Sir Edward Braddock to this side with six<br>
thousand splendidly equipped veterans, and offered large sums for<br>
fitting out regiments of provincials. Braddock arrived in February,<br>
1755, but moved very languidly. This was not altogether his fault, for<br>
he had difficulties with the governors and they with their legislatures.<br>
<br>

<br>
At last off for Fort Du Quesne, he took a needlessly long route, through<br>
Virginia instead of Pennsylvania. He scorned advice, marching and<br>
fighting stiffly according to the rules of the Old World military art,<br>
heeding none of Franklin's and Washington's sage hints touching savage<br>
modes of warfare. The consequence was this brave Briton's defeat and<br>
death. As he drew near to Fort Du Quesne, he fell into a carefully<br>
prepared ambuscade. Four horses were shot under him. Mounting a fifth he<br>
spurred to the front to inspire his men, forbidding them seek the<br>
slightest cover, as Washington urged and as the provincials successfully<br>
did. The regulars, obeying, were half of them killed in their tracks,<br>
the remainder retreating, in panic at first, to Philadelphia. Braddock<br>
died, and was buried at Great Meadows, where his grave is still to be<br>
seen.<br>

<br>
Washington was the only mounted officer in this action who was not<br>
killed or fatally wounded, a fact at the time regarded specially<br>
providential. On his return, aged twenty-three, the Rev. Samuel Davies,<br>
afterward President of the College of New Jersey, referred to him in his<br>
sermon as "that heroic youth, Colonel Washington, whom I cannot but hope<br>
Providence has preserved in so signal a manner for some important<br>
service to his country."<br>
<br>
[1757]<br>
<br>
The early part of this war witnessed the tragic occurrence immortalized<br>
by Longfellow's "Evangeline," the expulsion of the French from Acadia.<br>
The poem is too favorable to these people. They had never become<br>
reconciled to English rule, and were believed on strong evidence to be<br>
active in promoting French schemes against the English. It was resolved<br>
to scatter them among the Atlantic settlements. The act was savage, and<br>
became doubly so through the unmeant cruelties attending its execution.<br>
The poor wretches were huddled on the shore weeks too soon for their<br>
transports. Families were broken up, children forcibly separated from<br>
parents. The largest company was carried to Massachusetts, many to<br>
Pennsylvania, some to the extreme South. Not a few, crushed in spirit,<br>
became paupers. A number found their way to France, a number to<br>
Louisiana, a handful back to Nova Scotia.<br>
<br>
Braddock was succeeded by the fussy and incompetent Earl of Loudon,<br>
1756-57, whom Franklin likened to Saint George on the sign-posts,<br>
"always galloping but never advancing." He gathered twelve thousand men<br>
for the recapture of Louisburg, but exaggerated reports of the French<br>
strength frightened him from the attempt. Similar inaction lost him Fort<br>
William Henry on Lake George. The end of the year 1757 saw the English<br>
cause on this side at low ebb, Montcalm, the tried and brilliant French<br>
commander, having outwitted or frightened the English officers at every<br>
point.<br>

From this moment all changes. William Pitt, subsequently Lord Chatham,<br>
now became the soul of the British ministry. George III. had dismissed<br>
him therefrom in 1757, but Newcastle found it impossible to get on<br>
without him. The great commoner had to be recalled, this time to take<br>
entire direction of the war.<br>

[1758]<br>
<br>
Pitt had set his mind on the conquest of Canada. He superseded Loudon<br>
early in 1758 by General Amherst, who was seconded by Wolfe and by<br>
Admiral Boscawen, both with large re-enforcements. They were to reduce<br>
Louisburg. It was an innovation to assign important commands like these<br>
to men with so little fame and influence, but Pitt did not care. He<br>
believed his appointees to be brave, energetic, skilful, and the event<br>
proved his wisdom. Louisburg fell, and with it the whole of Cape Breton<br>
Island and also Prince Edward.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately General Abercrombie had not been recalled with Loudon. The<br>
same year, 1758, he signally failed to capture Ticonderoga, leaving the<br>
way to Montreal worse blocked than before. Fort Du Quesne, however,<br>
General Forbes took this year at little cost, rechristening it<br>
Pittsburgh in honor of the heroic minister who had ordered the<br>
enterprise.<br>
<br>
[1759]<br>
<br>
In the year 1759 occurred a grand triple movement upon Canada. Amherst,<br>
now general-in-chief, was to clear the Champlain Valley, and Prideaux<br>
with large colonial forces to reduce Fort Niagara. Both had orders,<br>
being successful in these initial attacks, to move down the St. Lawrence<br>
and unite with Wolfe, who was to sail up that river and beset Quebec.<br>
Prideaux was splendidly successful, as indeed was Amherst in time,<br>
though longer than he anticipated in securing Ticonderoga and Crown<br>
Point.<br>
<br>

<big><big>General Wolfe.<br>
<br>
Meantime Wolfe at Quebec was trying in all ways to manoeuvre the crafty<br>
Montcalm out of his impregnable works. Failing, he in his eagerness<br>
suffered himself to attempt an assault upon the city, which proved not<br>
only vain but terribly costly. A weaker commander would now have given<br>
up, but Wolfe had red hair, and the grit usually accompanying.<br>
Undaunted, he planned the hazardous enterprise of rowing up the St.<br>
Lawrence by night, landing with five thousand picked men at the foot of<br>
the precipitous ascent to the Plains of Abraham, and scaling those<br>
heights to face Montcalm from the west. The Frenchman, stunned at the<br>
sight which day brought him, lost no time in attacking. In the hot<br>
battle which ensued, September 13, 1759, both commanders fell, Wolfe<br>
cheering his heroes to sure victory, Montcalm urging on his forlorn hope<br>
in vain. The English remained masters of the field and in five days<br>
Quebec capitulated.<br>

Vaudreuil, the French commander at Montreal, sought to dislodge the<br>
English ere the ice left the river in the spring of 1760, and succeeded<br>
in driving them within their works. Each side then waited and hoped for<br>
help from beyond sea so soon as navigation opened. It came the earlier<br>
to the English, who were gladdened on May 11th by the approach of a<br>
British frigate, the forerunner of a fleet. They now chased Vaudreuil<br>
back into Montreal, where they were met by Haviland from Crown Point and<br>
by Amherst from Oswego. France's days of power in America were ended.<br>
Her fleet of twenty-two sail intended for succor met total destruction<br>
in the Bay des Chaleurs and by the Peace of Paris, 1763, she surrendered<br>
to her victorious antagonist every foot of her American territory east<br>
of the Mississippi, save the city of New Orleans.<br>
<br>
The Indians were thus left to finish this war alone. Pontiac, the brave<br>
and cunning chief of the Ottawas, aghast at the rising might of the<br>
English, and the certain fate of his race without the French for<br>
helpers, organized a conspiracy including nearly every tribe this side<br>
the Mississippi except the Six Nations, to put to the sword all the<br>
English garrisons in the West. Fatal success waited upon the plan. It<br>
was in 1763 Forts Sandusky, St. Joseph (southeast of Lake Michigan),<br>
Miami (Fort Wayne), Presque Isle (Erie, Pa.), Le Boeuf, Venango, and<br>
Pittsburgh were attacked and all but the last destroyed, soldiers and<br>
settlers murdered with indescribable barbarities. Pittsburgh held out<br>
till re-enforced, at dreadful cost in blood, by Colonel Bouquet and his<br>
Highlanders, who marched from Philadelphia.<br>

The hottest and longest conflict was at Detroit, Major Gladwyn<br>
commanding, where Pontiac himself led the onset, heading perhaps a<br>
thousand men. The siege was maintained with fearful venom from May 11th<br>
till into October. The English tried a number of sallies, brave, fatal,<br>
vain, and were so hard pressed by their bloodthirsty foe that only<br>
timely and repeated re-enforcements saved them. At last the savages,<br>
becoming, as always, disunited and straitened for supplies, sullenly<br>
made peace; and at the call of the rich and now free Northwest, caravans<br>
of English immigrants thronged thither to lay under happiest auspices<br>
the foundations of new States.<br>
